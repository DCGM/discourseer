If an article mentions the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in just one paragraph, the news values ​​must be relevant to that paragraph, not just in general (i.e., if Biden comments on something that is not related to the conflict being covered, do not code him as an elite person present - but if Biden comments on, say, the terms of a ceasefire, then code as yes.",
