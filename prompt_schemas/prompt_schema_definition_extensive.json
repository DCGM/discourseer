The political representation of the Czech Republic holds strong pro-Israeli stances, arguably based on historical experiences (both Czechs and Jews struggled for wider political recognition of their nations during the World War I and World War Two) and contemporary political orientation (after 1989, the Czech Republic takes the Global West as its allies and dissociates from the East, namely Russia). The representation of Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Czech news and the stances of political representatives of the Czech Republic need not be aligned with each other, as the principles of democracy guarantee. Nonetheless, the sheer understanding of the Jews as those culturally closer to \"us\" is not marginal, as well as implicit attitudes of islamophobia. \nThe overall conflict between Palestine and Israel is a highly polarized and complicated one, so please do your best to avoid any overinterpretation or bias that could favour one of its side. \nYour expertise is crucial in identifying routinized practices of journalists, such as news values, frames, or sourcing.
