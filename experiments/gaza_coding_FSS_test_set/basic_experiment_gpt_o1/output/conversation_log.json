F. Kennedyho (JFK) v New Yorku. Na Nový rok, kdy protestovali na silnici vedoucí k jednomu z terminálů, bylo podle webu listu New York Post zpožděno 60 letů. Předvolání k výslechu podle serveru tentokrát dostalo sedm protestujících, aniž by byl někdo zatčen.\n\n\nPozemní komunikaci Belt Parkway vedoucí k letištnímu terminálu číslo 4 ochromily pomalu jedoucí vozy s palestinskými vlajkami, několik protestujících vedle nich kráčelo pěšky.\n\n„Newyorská policie, Ku-klux-klan, izraelská armáda - všichni jste stejní,“ znělo z megafonu jednoho z těchto aut.\n\nProtestu se zúčastnil i nákladní vůz, který promítal snímky izraelských vojáků a palestinských dětí spolu s tvrzením, že židovský stát proti dětem vede válku.\n\nPolicie nakonec jeden z úseků silnice dočasně uzavřela, aby zabránila příjezdu dalších protestujících. Poté, co se většině demonstrantů nepodařilo dostat až do areálu letiště JFK, zamířili k menšímu letišti LaGuardia, do jehož prostor však rovněž nepronikli.\n\nProtestující v prvním dni letošního roku omezili i přístup k vlaku AirTrain, který jezdí mezi jednotlivými terminály letiště JFK.\n\nNa největším newyorském letišti bylo 1. ledna zpožděno celkem 60 letů, z toho v 15 případech kvůli tomu, že se včas k letadlu nedostala ani posádka, informoval s odvoláním na letištní úřady list New York Post.\n\nUž minulou středu propalestinští demonstranti zablokovali zhruba na 20 minut dopravu na silnici Van Wyck Expressway, která rovněž vede k letišti JFK. Tehdy newyorská policie zatkla 26 lidí. V tentýž den blokovali jiní protestující i hlavní dopravní tepnu na mezinárodní letiště v kalifornském Los Angeles.\n\nOd říjnového útoku palestinského teroristického hnutí Hamás v jižním Izraeli a následné odvetě židovského státu v podobě vojenské operace v Pásmu Gazy se v USA konají podobné akce opakovaně.\n\n\n\n"

A připomněl holokaust\n\nZástupce Izraele v pátek před Mezinárodním soudním dvorem (ICJ) v Haagu odmítl obvinění své země z páchání genocidy v Pásmu Gazy, které ve čtvrtek vznesla Jihoafrická republika. Připomněl mimo jiné holokaust Židů. JAR podle něj v Haagu přednáší nepodložená tvrzení a zkresluje informace.\n\n\nPokud byla proti někomu spáchána genocida, tak to bylo proti Izraeli, řekl zástupce Izraele v druhý den jednání u ICJ a připomněl několik konkrétních případů vražd a násilí spáchaných během říjnového útoku palestinského teroristického hnutí Hamás na jih Izraele.\n\nPokud by Izrael vyhověl jihoafrické žádosti na okamžité zastavení izraelské vojenské operace v Pásmu Gazy, stal by se bezbranným, řekl u soudu právní poradce izraelského ministra zahraničí Tal Becker.\n\nDodal, že pokud v této oblasti probíhá genocida, je vedená proti Izraeli, protože Hamás se otevřeně hlásí k cíli zničit Izrael. JAR podle Beckera udržuje vztahy s Hamásem a čelní představitelé palestinského hnutí byli viděni v africké zemi i po říjnových útocích.\n\nJihoafrická republika podala stížnost k ICJ, v níž viní Izrael z genocidy v palestinském Pásmu Gazy. JAR v prvním kroku požaduje, aby soud předběžným opatření nařídil okamžité zastavení izraelské vojenské operace v Gaze. I kdyby to soud udělal, neočekává se, že by Izrael kvůli tomu boje ukončil.\n\nVe čtvrtek své argumenty v Haagu přednesli zástupci JAR, kteří popsali rozsah destrukce Pásma Gazy, kde bombardování zničilo více než polovinu domů a kde statisíce lidí podle OSN trpí hlady.\n\nJihoafričtí právníci kritizovali i vysoké izraelské činitele, včetně premiéra Benjamina Netanjahua, za „genocidní rétoriku“. JAR tvrdí, že Izrael se dopouští genocidy masivním bombardováním a zabíjením civilistů a také tím, že jim nezajišťuje v potřebném množství humanitární pomoc.\n\nTel Aviv zahájil vojenské operace v Pásmu Gazy v reakci na útok Hamásu na jihu Izraele, který si podle židovského státu vyžádal zhruba 1200 obětí. Hamás navíc stále drží v Gaze zhruba 130 unesených jako rukojmí. Při odvetných útocích Izraele v Pásmu Gazy podle tvrzení Hamásu zahynulo přes 23 tisíc lidí. Tento údaj nelze nezávisle ověřit.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "The text to analyze is: Za vysokým počtem obětí požáru stanového městečka v Rafahu byla vybuchující palestinská munice\n\nPočet obětí požáru po izraelském útoku na Rafah stoupl na 45, uvedly palestinské úřady. Stanové městečko ve čtvrti Tal Sultán, kde našli útočiště uprchlíci, oheň zcela zničil. Video z rychle se šířícího požáru doprovázel rozhovor dvou Palestinců, který odhalil, proč k tragédii došlo. Izraelská střela zasáhla jeep, který vezl munici.\n\n\nZatímco plameny rychle pohlcují stany, dva Palestinci, kteří tragédii natáčejí, se baví o příčině požáru. Jeden se ptá, co udělali Izraelci: „Zaútočili na sklad zbraní?“ Druhý mu odpovídá: „Žádný sklad zbraní: Auto plné munice a zbraní. Byl to jeep.“\n\nPrvní se ptá, jestli byl nějaké palestinské radikální skupiny: „Patřil klukům?“ Druhý ho ujišťuje, že ano: „Samozřejmě, komu jinému.“ V titulcích na videu je v závorce uvedeno, že mluví o Hamásu, ale jméno této organizace nepadne. Nelze vyloučit, že munice byla Islámského džihádu, který se specializuje na raketové ostřelování.\n\nPalestinec na videu ještě varuje, že kdykoli může přiletět raketa, protože při požáru vybuchuje další a další munice: „Spálí nás a zbaví nás toho všeho… Měli bychom zemřít a toto nevidět.“\n\nCílem izraelského útoku byli dva vysocí představitelé Hamásu, z nichž jeden byl zapojen do organizování teroristických útoků na Západním břehu Jordánu. Izrael oznámil, že se je podařilo zlikvidovat.\n\nPočet obětí vyvolal velké pobouření a odsouzení ze strany zemí Evropské unie, OSN, Egypta, Kataru a Saúdské Arábie. Generální tajemník OSN António Guterres na sociální síti odsoudil izraelskou akci, při níž zahynulo mnoho nevinných civilistů, kteří hledali jen útočiště před konfliktem: „V Gaze není žádné bezpečné místo. Tahle hrůza musí skončit“.\n\nIzrael kvůli němu opět čelí tlaku od spojenců, aby se vyhýbal civilním obětem. „Izrael má právo jít po Hamásu, chápeme, že při tomto útoku byli zabiti dva vysocí představitelé teroristického Hamásu, jako jsme dali jasně najevo, že Izrael musí podniknout všechna možná opatření na ochranu civilistů,“ stojí v prohlášení americké Národní bezpečnostní rady. Kvůli útoku se sejde Rada bezpečnosti, napsal list The Times of Israel\n\nNetanjahu: Pro nás tragédie, pro Hamás strategie\n\nIzraelské obranné síly (IDF), které vyšetřují okolnosti útoku, uvedly podle listu The Times of Israel, že dvě střely použité při útoku měly „zmenšenou hlavici“, což je úprava pro útoky tohoto typu na osoby v nepancéřovaných vozidlech.\n\nIDF dodaly, že útok nebyl podniknut ve vytyčené humanitární zóně, jak se uvádělo. Ta leží na pobřeží v oblasti Mawasi, které je ale přeplněné.\n\n„Navzdory našim snahám nikomu neublížit došlo k tragickému incidentu. My tento incident vyšetřujeme. Pro nás je to tragédie, pro Hamás strategie,“ dodal izraelský premiér Benjamin Netanjahu k tomu, proč bylo tolik obětí při útoku, kdy shořelo stanové městečko, jímž projížděl jeep napěchovaný municí.\n\n.\n\n\n"

Podle informací listu je však nutné ještě doladit detaily.\n\nRukojmí Hamás a další radikální skupiny zadržují od teroristického útoku na Izrael ze 7. října. Při něm útočníci zabili přes 1100 lidí a dalších zhruba 250 unesli.\n\nVe své moci jich nadále mají přes 130, propuštění části rukojmích se podařilo dosáhnout při týdenním příměří v listopadu.

        "content": "The text to analyze is: Teroristé si zamilovali „podzemní ementál“\n\nKonsternováni humanitární katastrofou biblických rozměrů, která se v Gaze odehrává nad zemí, přehlížíme, co se děje pod jejím povrchem. Totiž zuřivou podzemní řež, k níž se ve stále větší míře uchylují slabší ve střetech se silnějšími. Ten trend nabírá na obrátkách a vystavuje Západ stále většímu nebezpečí.\n\n\nTunely a podzemní skrýše si doslova zamiloval nejen Tálibán, ale později i Islámský stát a nyní Hamás. Přičemž s válčením v takových podmínkách si dnes nevědí moc rady ani ty nejvyspělejší země. To po celém světě se zájmem sledují militantní a kriminální skupiny, odhodlané udělat vše, aby státy a jejich bezpečnostní složky dokázaly položit na lopatky.\n\nAnakonda a jiné příběhy\n\nKdyž krátce po teroristických útocích al-Káidy na Spojené státy vpadly západní armády na podzim roku 2001 do Afghánistánu, aby vymýtily tamní výcvikové tábory, odehrály se ty nejtěžší boje pod povrchem. Ustupující místní bojovníci se stáhli do jeskynního komplexu Tora Bora v horách na hranicích s Pákistánem, kde dokázali čelit zdrcujícím leteckým úderům a vyhnout se přímému střetu se silnějším soupeřem.\n\nTamní úkryty, propojené sítí tunelů a opatřené větracími šachtami, muničními sklady i ubikacemi pro tisíc mužů, se podařilo dobýt až po týdnu urputných bojů jen díky tomu, že předtím celý komplex měsíc zasypávaly pumy z amerických bombardérů B-52.\n\nPřesto na spojence čekalo zkraje roku 2002 další překvapení, když během operace Anakonda pronásledovali zbytky Tálibánu a al-Káidy v afghánské provincii Chóst a museli svést tvrdou bitvu v okolí výcvikového tábora Zhawar Kili, kde byly v jeskyních propojených sedmdesáti tunely ukryty mimo jiné i hotel, mešita, garáže, dílny a těžká vojenská technika. Aby uspěli, museli zaskočení Američané nakonec nasadit termobarické bomby – až ony dokázaly podzemní prostory nasytit hořlavým aerosolem, jehož exploze vykonala dílo zkázy.\n\nAni tak se ale Usámu bin Ládina tehdy dopadnout nepodařilo – dávno předtím si už stihl vybudovat podpovrchové ústupové cesty do Pákistánu. Před Američany byl vždy o krok napřed, terén důvěrně znal už z dob, kdy zde jako mladík v roce 1987 po boku afghánských mudžahedínů vybojoval bitvu proti sovětské armádě, a stal se tak jakýmsi arabským Che Guevarou.\n\nTaktika boje pod zemí i příslušná infrastruktura se v regionu dědí. Tálibán a al-Káida tak ve střetu s Američany jen vycizelovaly úspěšnou partyzánskou válku, kterou před nimi provozovali mudžáhidové proti Sovětům (1979–1989). Jak píše válečný historik Mir Bahmanyar v knize Jeskyně Afghánistánu 1979–2004, byly tunely a zavlažovací kanály soustavně využívány k utajeným přesunům, ukrývání zbraní a překvapivým útokům ze zálohy.\n\nPodstatné pro bin Ládinův souboj se Spojenými státy bylo, že do těchto míst již za protisovětského džihádu coby syn majitele největší saúdskoarabské stavební firmy dovezl buldozery a bagry, aby zbudoval podzemní komplexy. Stejně jako předtím Britové na západní frontě první světové války zaúkolovali důlní inženýry, aby poddolovali německé zákopy, také bin Ládin a jemu podobní čerpali expertizu z civilního sektoru.\n\nTunely v horách v Mali\n\nA jak se dnes technologie hloubení tunelů zlevňují, povstalci i organizovaný zločin se skrývají pod zem stále častěji. Mohli se o tom přesvědčit například Francouzi, když dostali výprask v Mali poté, co tam v roce 2013 intervenovali, aby potlačili povstání o nezávislost usilujících Tuaregů.\n\nJejich Národní hnutí za osvobození Azavadu se tehdy propojilo s islamisty v Maghrebu, za násobky běžné mzdy zaplatilo lokální kopáče a na hornatém severu země se ukrylo do jeskyní a tunelů vybavených slunečními elektrárnami i zahrádkami pro pěstování potravin. Odtud pak podnikalo překvapivé útoky a frustrované Francouze nutilo zas a znovu obsazovat území, o nichž soudili, že je již kontrolují…\n\nPod zemí se síly vyrovnávají\n\nAfghánský a malijský příběh ukazují, jak se dnes nestátním aktérům daří vzdorovat velmocím: za hloubení tunelů utratí o dost méně, než kolik musejí pravidelné armády vynaložit na jejich ničení. Ty navíc ztrácejí přehled o pohybech nepřítele a jsou nuceny vést boje prakticky naslepo. Početní převaha tak rázem ztrácí na důležitosti, stejně jako drahé vybavení, které se pod zemí nemůže uplatnit. Pokud se státy odhodlají za nepřítelem sestoupit, z asymetrického konfliktu se rázem stává vyrovnaný. Ke slovu se v podzemí dostanou nanejvýš jednoduché lehké zbraně, kterými ovšem disponují i povstalci. Velmoci jsou pak nuceny k bojům muže proti muži, čemuž se ve snaze eliminovat lidské ztráty obvykle vyhýbají. Zatímco navíc povstalci v tunelech a jeskyních válčí na vlastní půdě, vojáci bloudí a nezřídka pálí do vlastních řad, protože jim nefungují navigační systémy.\n\nSituace se pak ještě zhorší, když bojůvky začnou kombinovat válčení pod zemí s bitvami ve městech, kde tunely záměrně hloubí pod civilní infrastrukturou. Přesně takový postup volil nejen Islámský stát v Mosulu, ale nyní i Hamás v Gaze. Samozřejmě přitom počítá s mezinárodním veřejným míněním, které po armádách žádá ohledy na civilisty, zatímco teroristům prakticky nic nebrání v tom, aby si z nich dělali živé štíty.\n\nUčenlivý Hamás\n\nPříběh Hamásu podle izraelské politoložky Daphné Richemond-Barakové a její pionýrské knihy Válčení v podzemí (2018) demonstruje, jak učenliví lotři umějí být. První přeshraniční tunely mezi Gazou a Sinajským poloostrovem se totiž ve městě Rafáh a jeho okolí objevily už záhy po podpisu mírové dohody mezi Izraelem a Egyptem v roce 1979. Tehdy však ještě nepředstavovaly bezpečnostní hrozbu – sloužily výhradně k pašování spotřebního zboží. Teprve po stažení izraelské armády z Gazy zabral v roce 2005 pašerákům jejich infrastrukturu Hamás a učinil z ní svůj klíčový byznysový nástroj. Zdaněním tunelů obstarávajících 60 procent importu do Gazy získával pětinu rozpočtu a využívat jich začal také k mohutnému zbrojení.\n\nV letech 2008–2009 se pak síť tunelů poprvé stala součástí bojů v městských aglomeracích. To když ji Hamás úspěšně použil k ukrývání arzenálu, přesouvání bojovníků a překvapivým úderům na izraelskou armádu, která se do Gazy vrátila i proto, že tunely nebyla schopna zničit ze vzduchu.\n\nBěhem operace Pilíř obrany se proto Izrael v roce 2012 kromě zabití velitele Hamásu Ahmada Džabarího zaměřil i na likvidaci asi 140 tunelů. A byl šokován, když časem objevil mimo jiné také kilometrový koridor z města Chán Júnis až ke kibucu Ejn ha-Šloša – dosud nejsofistikovanější zařízení, opatřené kolejnicemi, elektrickými rozvody a betonovými výztuhami, leželo několik desítek metrů pod zemí. Množství šachet a východů naznačovalo, že ho Hamás hloubil minimálně rok s cílem zaútočit na Izrael. Po této zkušenosti židovský stát tunely definitivně vyhodnotil jako velmi závažnou hrozbu. A uvědomil si, že Hamás jich může využít nejen k útokům na armádu, ale i na civilisty…\n\nDěsivý klid\n\nJak Radě OSN pro lidská práva řekli během výpovědí v roce 2015 Izraelci žijící blízko Gazy, jejich strach vyvěral z toho, že z tunelů mohli teroristé zaútočit prakticky kdekoliv a kdykoliv: „Svým způsobem jsou tunely děsivější než rakety, protože nedostaneme varování.“ Někteří proto dokonce zakázali dětem chodit ven. Další své trauma vyjádřili takto: „Když je klid, bojíme se ještě víc, protože nevíme, zda něco nepřijde z podzemí.“ Že nešlo o plané obavy, dokládá operace Ochranné ostří, kterou Izrael zahájil v roce 2014 – po únosu a vraždě tří izraelských chlapců se tehdy odvetné bombardování soustředilo právě na tunely. A to z obav, aby se podobný teror neopakoval. Mohutnou pozemní operaci pak Tel Aviv spustil až ve chvíli, kdy se přesto bojovníci Hamásu pokusili tunelem znovu dostat do kibucu Súfa. Izraelští vojáci se ovšem museli po celou dobu vyrovnávat s řadou bleskových protiútoků ze zálohy, po nichž povstalci rychle mizeli v podzemí, a to šachtami maskovanými v nemocnicích, mešitách či soukromých bytech.\n\nLakmusový talíř\n\nNavzdory všem minulým izraelským snahám je dnes Pásmo Gazy poddolované jako ementál. Četná svědectví Palestinců hovoří o tom, jak se jim kvůli vibracím doma třese nádobí a v noci nemohou spát, protože je ruší hluk vrtných souprav kdesi v podzemí. Obávají se, že nekonečná série válek nakonec zničí jejich domovy a dost možná i životy prostě proto, že se Hamás rozhodl vyvrtat tunel nebo vyhloubit odpalovací rampu právě pod jejich čtvrtí.\n\nAktuální izraelská vojenská doktrína říká, že je třeba palestinské civilisty bombardováním pokárat za to, že se proti Hamásu důrazně nevymezili. A přimět je, aby se od něj odvrátili. Její výsledky jsou ale katastrofální: Gaza je dnes prakticky srovnaná se zemí, zatímco infrastruktura Hamásu umístěná hluboko pod povrchem zůstává zřejmě nepoškozena…\n\nKaždopádně ale platí, že bez likvidace labyrintu budovaného pod Gazou od roku 2005 není možné, aby nad pásmem kdokoli převzal kontrolu. Nebude toho schopna ani izraelská armáda, ani Palestinská samospráva Mahmúda Abbáse, a už vůbec by to nezmohly modré přilby pod hlavičkou OSN. Nikdo totiž nebude schopen garantovat, že povstalci z Gazy znovu nezaútočí na Egypt, Izrael, případně kohokoli – jen aby ukázali, že nastolit v regionu bezpečí není dnes schopen vůbec nikdo.\n"

        "content": "The text to analyze is: Izraelský ministr nevyloučil jaderný útok na Gazu. Netanjahu ho vzápětí suspendoval\n\nAmichaj Elijahu, izraelský ministr národního dědictví Izraele z krajně pravicové strany Ocma jehudit (Židovská síla) prohlásil, že jednou z izraelských možností ve válce v Gaze je shodit na Pásmo jadernou bombu. Izraelský premiér Benjamin Netanjahu vzápětí podobné úvahy popřel s tím, že Elijahuova slova jsou „odtržena od reality“ a ministra do odvolání suspendoval.\n\n\nServer Times of Israel v neděli uvedl, že Elijahu v rozhovoru pro izraelské rádio Radio Kol BaRama na otázku, zda by měl Izrael svrhnout na enklávu jadernou bombu, odvětil, že je to „jedna z možností“.\n\nIzraelský premiér Netanjahu na Elijahuova slova rychle reagoval. „Slova Amichaje Elijahua jsou odtržena od reality. Izrael a jeho obranné síly jednají podle nejvyšších standardů mezinárodního práva, aby ochránily nevinné lidi a budou v tom pokračovat po celou dobu, dokud nevyhrají,“ uvedl v prohlášení Netanjahu.\n\nElijahu následně v neděli ráno přispěchal s vysvětlením na sociální síti X. „Každému s půlkou mozku je jasné, že zmínka o atomovce byla metaforická,“ napsal. „Musíme ukázat silnou a nepřiměřenou reakci na teror, která nacistům a jejich stoupencům ukáže, že terorismus nemá cenu,“ dodal.\n\nŠéf opozice Jair Lapid vyzval k okamžitému odvolání ministra Elijahua, jeho výroky má za „děsivé a šílené poznámky nezodpovědného ministra“. „Urazil rodiny zajatců, urazil izraelskou společnost a poškodil naše mezinárodní postavení. Účast extremistů ve vládě ohrožuje nás a úspěch válečných cílů – porazit Hamás a osvobodit rukojmí,“ řekl Lapid.\n\nNetanjahu ministra Elijahu vyloučil až do odvolání z jednání vlády. Další členové kabinetu ale vidí premiérův krok jako bezvýznamný, protože zasedání vlády se od začátku války s Hamásem v podstatě nekonají a většina práce se řeší po telefonu, uvedl server Ynet podle ToI.\n\nMinistrovo neoptrané prohlášení využilo teroristické hnutí Hamás. Mluvčí Hamásu reagoval prohlášením, že Elijahu zosobňuje „bezprecedentní zločinný izraelský terorismus, který představuje nebezpečí pro celý region a svět“, napsala agentura Reuters.\n\nNutno dodat, že Elijahu není členem bezpečnostního kabinetu, který se podílí na rozhodování o dalších postupech ve válce s Hamásem, ani na něj nemá vliv. Netanjahu se však s jeho stranou Ocma jehudit, v jejímž čele stojí extremistický Itamar Ben Gvir, spojil, aby mohl sestavit vládu – a tím podle kritikům této krajně pravicové straně umožnil stát se součástí izraelského politického mainstreamu.\n\nElijahu se také kriticky vyjadřoval vůči humanitární pomoci pro obyvatele Gazy, když prohlásil, že „nebudeme nacistům poskytovat humanitární pomoc“, podle něj v Gaze není žádný civilista „nezapojený“ (do jednání Hamásu). Premiér Netanjahu přitom v roce 2018 umožnil přesun peněz z Kataru do rukou Hamásu (celkem šlo minimálně o 90 milionů dolarů, tedy zhruba přes 2 miliardy korun) na izraelské území s odůvodněním, že je to cena za příměří.\n\nMinistr také obhajoval znovuzmocnění se teritoria a obnovení jeho osídlení. Když se ho zeptali na osud Palestinců, odpověděl: „Můžou jít do Irska nebo pouště, zrůdy z Gazy by si měly najít řešení samy.“ Podle Elijahua severní část Pásma nemá právo existovat a kdokoliv, kdo mává vlajkou Palestiny nebo Hamásu, by „neměl dále žít na povrchu Země“.\n\nIrsko dlouhodobě podporuje práva Palestinců, Izrael podle něj anektoval palestinská území. Teroristické útoky Hamásu Irsko nicméně důrazně odsuzuje jako neospravedlnitelné.\n\n\n\n"

Jedna raketa jemenských rebelů, kteří svým počínáním připomínají pirátské gangy u Afrického rohu, kontejnerové plavidlo zasáhla, další dvě sestřelilo americké námořnictvo, uvedl deník The Guardian. Armáda USA zároveň potopila tři malé húsíjské lodě, jejichž posádky střílely na americké vrtulníky a taktéž útočily na dánskou loď. Posádky povstalců podle USA nepřežily.\n\n\nPentagon na síti X uvedl, že incident s dánskou lodí byl už 23. húsíjským útokem v Rudém moři od 19. listopadu. Terčem se tentokrát stala dánská nákladní loď Maersk Hangzhou plující pod singapurskou vlajkou asi 55 námořních mil (bezmála 102 kilometrů) od jemenského přístavu Hudajdá.\n\nPodle The Guardian raketa na palubě nikoho nezranila a loď může pokračovat v plavbě. Firma Maersk nicméně na 48 hodin přerušila provoz svých lodí v oblasti.\n\nAmerická armáda vyslala vrtulníky po nouzovém volání z dánské lodi Maersk, k níž se povstalci dostali asi na 20 metrů a stříleli na ni. Ochranka nákladní lodi střelbu opětovala.\n\nAmerické ústřední velení (CENTCOM) uvedlo, že na volání o pomoc z dánské lodi odpověděly torpédoborce Gravely a Laboon, likvidaci dvou raket odpálených Húsíi si připsal Gravely.\n\nCENTCOM později informovalo, že americké síly v Rudém moři potopily tři malé lodě jemenských povstalců, kteří stříleli i na jejich vrtulníky. Čtvrté lodi se podařilo uprchnout. Posádky třech lodí podle armády nepřežily, počet mrtvých CENTCOM neuvedlo.\n\nHúsíjští rebelové podporovaní šíitským Íránem válčí od roku 2015 proti koalici vedené sunnitskou Saúdskou Arábií. Stali se významnou vojenskou silou v regionu. Mají desetitisíce bojovníků a od svých íránských spojenců získali velký arzenál raket a útočných dronů.\n\nHúsíjské útoky, o nichž jemenští rebelové tvrdí, že jsou odvetou za izraelské operace v Pásmu Gazy, výrazně narušily trasy v Rudém moři, kudy proudí až 12 procent celosvětového obchodu.\n\nUSA se postavily do čela námořní koalice, která chrání tranzitní trasy. Čítá více než dvě desítky zemí včetně Indie.\n\n\n\n"

Při násilnostech bylo zraněno nejméně 20 lidí, z toho devět policistů, někteří museli být hospitalizováni. Za incidentem podle vedení Dagestánu stojí Ukrajina.\n\n\nNásilnosti odstartovaly kolující zprávy na sociálních sítích o údajném záměru Moskvy přijmout v Dagestánu a v dalších severokavkazských regionech „běžence z Izraele“ a výzvy k odplatě za izraelské útoky na Gazu.\n\nNa letišti je potlačovaly narychlo povolané posily policejních zásahových jednotek z Machačkaly, Kaspijsku, Bujnaksku a dalších měst, celkem asi pět set těžkooděnců a policistů. Řada letů musela být kvůli nekontrolované situaci přesměrována na jiná letiště.\n\n„Na letišti (v Machačkale) jich byly stovky. Asi padesát mužů přistoupilo k letadlu a ptali se cestujících, zda jsou Židé. Řekl jsem, že ne. Já jsem Rus. Chtěli vidět můj pas. Měl jsem ruský pas. Potloukali se tam a pak se v určitém okamžiku stáhli,“ uvedl jeden z očitých svědků na nahrávce, z níž citoval izraelský list The Times of Israel.\n\nIzraelský premiér Benjamin Netanjahu Moskvu vyzval, aby „zajistila ochranu Izraelců“, a vyjádřil naději, že Rusko „aktivně zakročí proti účastníkům nepokojů i proti podněcování k násilí proti židům a Izraelcům“.\n\nRuské ozbrojené složky v pondělí ráno uvedly, že situaci již mají „zcela“ pod kontrolou: do pondělního rána policie zatkla 60 lidí, identifikováno bylo „dalších více než 150 aktivních účastníků nepokojů“, probíhaly výslechy. Letiště se nicméně znovu otevře nejspíš až 31. října, původně se podle ruskojazyčného portálu Meduza hovořilo o tom, že zůstane uzavřené jeden týden.\n\n„Ke znovuotevření dojde až po velmi pečlivém prohledání letiště, letištní haly a okolních prostor,“ uvedl ruský úřad Rosaviacija.\n\nVedení Dagestánu obvinilo „banderovce“\n\n„Nikdo neunikne,“ prohlásil Sergej Melikov, šéf jihoruského Dagestánu s převážně muslimským obyvatelstvem. „(Policie) prováděla foto- a videodokumentaci,“ uvedl. V souvislosti s bezprecedentními událostmi bylo zahájeno „trestní stíhání kvůli celé řadě trestných činů“, řekl také.\n\nZa nepokoji podle něj stojí „nepřátelé“. „Není žádným tajemstvím, že pokusy destabilizovat situaci v Dagestánu a vyvolat protestní nálady na pozadí etnické a náboženské nesnášenlivosti, jsou dílem našich nepřátel,“ prohlásil Melikov. Telegramový kanál Utro Dagestana, kde se také objevila oznámení o tzv. „běžencích z Izraele“, podle něj spravují na území Ukrajiny „zrádci a banderovci“.\n\nZakladatelem tohoto kanálu na sociální síti je bývalý ruský poslanec, nyní s ukrajinským občanstvím, Ilja Ponomarjov, který ale podle vlastních slov citovaných Meduzou nemá s tímto kanálem už více než rok nic společného.\n\nUkrajinský prezident Volodymyr Zelenskyj na síti X v reakci na nepokoje v Machačkale uvedl, že nejde o ojedinělý případ, ale projev „masově šířené kultury nenávisti k jiným národům, kterou v Rusku propagují státní televize, experti i moc“.\n\nPrezidenti Dagestánu, Karačajsko-Čerkeské a Kabardsko-Balkarské republiky v reakci na nepokoje v Machačkale obyvatele těchto ruských regionů vyzvali, aby se zdrželi násilí a projevů antisemitismu, napsal ruský web riasv.ru.\n\nTaké Institut pro studium války (ISW) s odvoláním na ruské ultranacionalisty napsal, že se antisemitské a protiizraelské nálady mohou přehoupnout i do jiných oblastí v regionu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

V Londýně vlála vlajka tauhídu\n\nVyšší desetitisíce propalestinských demonstrantů během sobotního pochodu deštivým Londýnem požadovaly zastavení izraelského bombardování Pásma Gazy. Podobné výzvy se ozývaly ve městech po celém světě. Protestní akce se očekávají i v neděli, povolená demonstrace je svolaná do Paříže. Berlín nedělní propalestinskou akci v centru města zakázal.\n\n\nInformuje o tom AP. Sobotní demonstrace v Londýně se podle odhadů policie zúčastnilo až sto tisíc lidí. Protestující se nejprve shromáždili u Mramorového oblouku poblíž Hyde Parku a odtud zamířili do vládní čtvrti Whitehall.\n\nZe záběrů zveřejněných na sociálních sítích je patrné, že někteří nesli vlajky symbolizující učení tauhíd, nauku o jedinosti boží. Tento typ vlajky přitom již dříve užívali mnozí islámští extremisté. Někteří Londýňané na sociálních sítích uváděli, že se snažili cestě, kterou pochodovali demonstranti, co nejvíce vyhnout.\n\nVálka zvýšila napětí po celém světě, židovské, ale i muslimské komunity se cítí být ohroženy, informuje AP. Londýnská metropolitní policie podle tohoto zdroje uvedla, že v říjnu zaznamenala třináctinásobný nárůst hlášení antisemitských trestných činů ve srovnání s loňským rokem. Více než dvojnásobně vzrostl počet hlášení o trestných činech namířených proti muslimům.\n\nBritská dopravní policie uvedla, že zahájila vyšetřování případu, kdy byl na internetu zveřejněn záznam, který podle všeho zachycuje řidiče londýnského metra, jak přes interkom metra vede cestující ke skandování „Svobodná, svobodná Palestina“.\n\nV Marseille se protestovalo i přes zákaz\n\nVe Francii se propalestinští demonstranti sešli v sobotu v několika městech včetně Rennes, Montpellier, Dijonu a Lyonu, kde tisíce lidí na centrálním náměstí skandovaly „my všichni jsme Palestinci“. V Marseille, druhém největším městě v zemi, vyšly do ulic sporadicky hloučky lidí, kteří mávali palestinskými vlajkami a křičeli „Osvoboďte Gazu“, přestože místní policie protest zakázala.\n\nPokojné demonstrace se v sobotu konaly také v německých městech.\n\n\n\n"

Není jasné, zda ji přijme\n\nTeroristické hnutí Hamás dostalo nabídku na přerušení bojů na 40 dní, uvedla v úterý s odkazem na své zdroje agentura Reuters. Podle nabídky, na které se shodli vyjednavači minulý týden v Paříži, by palestinské hnutí mělo propustit 40 rukojmí. Za jedno rukojmí by Izrael pustil deset Palestinců.\n\n\nPodle dohody by palestinské hnutí mělo propustit ženy, lidi mladší 19 let, nemocné a seniory, které drží v zajetí. Dohoda by umožnila také návrat části obyvatel s výjimkou bojeschopných mužů na sever Pásma Gazy, který v současnosti kontroluje izraelská armáda, či navýšení objemu pomoci na 500 kamionů denně. To by mělo umožnit opravu poničených nemocnic či závodů na výrobu pečiva v Pásmu Gazy.\n\nHamás zatím návrh nekomentoval, dodává agentura.\n\nV Izraeli však místní média také dávají najevo pesimismus, protože pochybují, že by Hamás nabídku přijal. Kanály 12 a 13 citovaly vysoké představitele, kteří se podíleli na vypracování návrhu dohody, s tím, že „neodpovídá požadavkům Hamásu“. Jde podle Palestinců o „nepřekročitelné hranice“, napsal list The Times of Israel. Příměří by bylo jen dočasné, zatímco Hamás chce trvalé.\n\nIzraelský ministr Benny Ganc současně varoval, že pokud nebude dohoda přijata, dojde k útoku na Rafáh.\n\nBiden věří v brzké příměří\n\nAmerický prezident Joe Biden vyjádřil naději, že dohodu o přerušení bojů se podaří uzavřít do příštího pondělí. „Můj bezpečnostní poradce mi řekl, že jsme blízko,“ prohlásil Biden při návštěvě zmrzlinářství.\n\nMluvčí amerického ministerstva zahraničí byl však obezřetnější. „Dosáhli jsme pokroku při jednání mezi Egyptem, Izraelem, Spojenými státy a Katarem,“ řekl mluvčí státního departementu Matthew Miller a upozornil, že není jasné, zda Hamás nabídku přijme.\n\nPodle Bidena Izrael souhlasil, že se nebude pouštět do vojenských akcí v době postního měsíce ramadánu, který začíná večer 10. března. Navíc je podle Al-Džazíry ochoten propustit i Palestince, kteří se dopustili „těžkých zločinů“.\n"

Nejenže měli málo jídla a museli být ve tmě. Dvanáctiletému chlapci ukazovali záběry z masakru Izraelců ze 7.října.\n\n\n„Když se dostal do Gazy, všichni obyvatelé, úplně všichni ho bili. Je to přitom 12leté dítě,“ řekla Deborah Cohenová francouzské televizi BFMTV, čím si musel projít její synovec Eitan Jahalomi. „Hamás ho nutil sledovat hrozná videa,“ svěřila se. Šlo o záznamy natočené bojovníky teroristického hnutí, kteří vraždili Izraelce při útoku ze 7. října.\n\n„Včera (v pondělí, když byl Eitan propuštěn) jsme byli tak šťastni, ale nyní, když o tom vím všechno, bojím se. Je to nepředstavitelné. Nevím, kdo by mohl udělat takové věci,“ řekla Cohenová, která je stále šokovaná nelidským chováním a brutalitou teroristů z Hamásu.\n\n„Chtěla jsem věřit, že budou s Eitanem dobře zacházet. Zcela jasně tomu tak nebylo. Tihle lidé jsou zrůdy,“ dodala.\n\nList The Times of Israel popsal příběh rodiny. Zatímco Eittanova matka Batševa dokázala během útoku utéci i s dvěma dcerami, Eitana teroristé odvezli z kibucu Nir Oz na mopedu. Jeho otec Ohad je nezvěstný. Ví se, že byl postřelen a zřejmě je držen v zajetí.\n\nÚtok na kibuc\n\n„Zažili jsme pogrom,“ uvedla matka k útoku na kibuc pro list The Times of Israel, „snili jsme o míru s Gazou a celé rodiny včetně dětí byly pozabíjeny.“\n\nPětičlenná rodina se na úvod útoku ukryla v zabezpečené místnosti, kam se uchylovala v době raketové palby. Když se ukázalo, že do kibucu vnikli teroristé z Hamásu, Ohad si sedl před zabezpečenou místnost s puškou, protože dveře nešly dobře zavřít. V přestřelce s teroristy, kteří vnikli do domu, byl Ohad zraněn.\n\nTeroristé pak vyhnali matku s dětmi a posadili je na moped. Na jednom seděla matka s desetiletou Jael a dvouletou dcerkou, na druhém byl Eitan spolu se zahraničním dělníkem.\n\nMatce se s dcerami v jednu chvíli podařilo utéct a schovat se. Pak je našli dva neozbrojení příslušníci Hamásu. Pokusili se je donutit, aby s nimi jely do Gazy, ale nepoužili násilí: „Měli jsme štěstí, narazili jsme na měkké teroristy,“ vypověděla. Matka se vrátila na méně zničený sever kibucu. Doufala, že najde Ohada, ale marně.\n\nDevítiletá jen šeptá\n\nHrůzy prožili i další unesení. Otec devítileté Emily Handové, která byla propuštěna v neděli, uvedl, že jeho dcera v noci pláče: „Nejvíc šokující a znepokojivé při setkání s ní bylo, že jen šeptala, takže jsem ji nemohl slyšel. Musel jsem dát ucho k jejím rtům. Nesměla dělat žádný hluk.“\n\nMnoho rukojmích bylo drženo v podzemních tunelech, kde bylo jen slabé světlo, pokud vůbec nějaké, a hlavně zima. Osmasedmdesátiletá Ruti Munderová, které byla propuštěna se svou 54letou dcerou Keren a devítiletým vnukem Ohadem Munderem Zichrim, říkala, že museli spát na lavicích bez matrací v dusivé místnosti, kde bylo málo čerstvého vzduchu. Sama měla štěstí, že dostala deku, protože mnozí další, včetně malých dětí, ne: „Zakryly jsme se dekou. Kluci spali pod lavicemi na zemi, protože jsme chtěli být blízko sebe.“\n\nÚnosci navíc rodinu rozdělili, její 78letý muž Avram s ní nebyl, byl držen jinde. Zůstává v zajetí. Z rádia v zajetí slyšela, že její syn Roy byl zabit v kibucu Nir Oz. Jiní ale neměli možnost slyšet žádné zprávy.\n\nJídlo se podle ní zhoršovalo. Napřed dostala kuře s rýží a dvakrát denně čaj, ale postupně se situace zhoršovala. Všichni už měli hlad, často byl jen chléb a humus v konzervě a později jen dva kousky chleba. Její příbuzní uvedli, že stará paní Munderová a její dcera zhubly v zajetí sedm kilogramů.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "The text to analyze is: Hizballáh má propracovanější systém tunelů než Hamás, tvrdí expert\n\nIzraelský zpravodajský expert Tal Be’eri už několik let zkoumá podzemní systémy Hamásu a Hizballáhu a i v souvislosti s Libanonem mluví o „zemi tunelů“. Na jihu této země podle něho zřídily šíitské milice obrovský široce rozvětvený systém tunelů, který je propracovanější, než vyhloubil Hamás v Pásmu Gazy.\n\n\nSpletité podzemní trasy v jižním Libanonu jsou dohromady dlouhé stovky kilometrů a táhnou se až k hranici s Izraelem, uvedl s odvoláním na Be’eriho list Times of Israel.\n\nBe’eri, šéf výzkumného a vzdělávacího centra Alma, které se zabývá bezpečnostními otázkami na severní hranici Izraele, již několik let zkoumá síť tunelů Íránem podporovaných šíitských milicí v Libanonu na základě veřejně dostupných informací. Už v dokumentu z roku 2021 Be’eri označil jižní Libanon za „zemi tunelů“. Tvrdí, že tato síť vznikla s pomocí poradců ze Severní Koreje a s podporou Íránu.\n\nHloubení tunelů v Libanonu probíhalo již v 80. letech, ke konci 90. let se pak práce zintenzivnily. Od počátku probíhaly s pomocí Severní Koreje, která má historické zkušenosti s kopáním tunelů v horských a skalnatých oblastech. Po druhé libanonské válce v roce 2006 se spojení s KLDR ještě posílilo a pomoc přišla i z Íránu.\n\nTaké zpravodajské informace naznačují, že v jižním Libanonu existuje rozsáhlá síť tunelů, hluboká a víceúrovňová, a že projekt úkrytů pod zemí na jihu Libanonu se zrodil mnohem dříve než obdobný v Pásmu Gazy.\n\nMapa prozradila polygony\n\nV roce 2018 izraelská armáda v rámci operace Severní štít našla a zničila „přeshraniční tunel“ Hizballáhu pod izraelsko-libanonskou hranicí. „Toto je první tunel, který jsme našli. Poté se přesuneme k dalším. Víme, že tu jsou,“ uvedl tehdy mluvčí armády.\n\nPřed několika lety se Be’erimu podařilo na tzv. darknetu dohledat „mapu polygonů“, která pokrývala takzvanou „zemi tunelů“ v jižním Libanonu. „Na mapě neznámý autor vyznačil polygony (kruhy) označující 36 zeměpisných oblastí, měst a vesnic,“ napsal v roce 2021.\n\n„Podle našeho názoru tyto polygony označují střediska Hizballáhu jako součást ‚obranného‘ plánu proti izraelské invazi do Libanonu. Každé místní středisko nasazení (‚obrany‘) disponuje sítí místních podzemních tunelů. Mezi všemi těmito centry byla vybudována infrastruktura regionálních tunelů, které jsou s nimi vzájemně propojeny,“ tvrdí odborník.\n\nBe’eri odhadl, že souhrnná délka tunelové sítě Hizballáhu v jižním Libanonu dosahuje stovek kilometrů.\n\nČtyři druhy podzemních labyrintů\n\n„V Libanonu jsme identifikovali několik druhů tunelů. Za prvé to, čemu všichni říkají útočné tunely, bývají velké a dlouhé a vedou z oblasti do oblasti. Dá se do nich vjíždět vozidly, a dokonce i středně velkými nákladními auty,“ objasňuje Be’eri.\n\nVedle nich se nacházejí taktické tunely, které izraelská armáda odhalila a zničila v rámci operace Severní štít v lednu 2019. Jsou určeny pouze pro pohyb lidí a v krajním případě třeba i motocyklu. Nacházejí se v blízkosti vesnic a umožňují teroristům bojovat z podzemí – střílet z tunelových šachet a skrčit se zpět, přezbrojit se ze skladů zbraní uvnitř, odpočinout si a znovu se vynořit.\n\nJako třetí typ Be’eri zmiňuje tzv. přibližující tunely. Podobají se útočným, avšak nepřekračují hranice. Umožňují přístup téměř k hranici a odtud se vynořit a zaútočit.\n\nDalší druh tunelů představují takzvané tunely výbušné. Jsou vykopány pouze za účelem umístění výbušnin uvnitř, přičemž zařízení mají být odpálena při případných pozemních operacích izraelské armády na zemi uvnitř Libanonu.\n\n„Některé podzemní systémy může Hizballáh využít i k odpalování přesných zbraní,“ upozorňuje expert. „Z jejich pohledu to není složité. Rakety Fatíh-110, balistické střely země-země, bývají převáženy na nákladních automobilech. Podzemní infrastruktura umožňuje průjezd nákladního automobilu na místo, odkud má být střela odpálena. Teoreticky může být v místě odpalu vybudována plošina nebo svah vedoucí z tunelu nahoru. Nákladní vozidlo vyjede z tunelu, vystřelí a vrátí se zpět dolů,“ uzavírá.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "The text to analyze is: Hizballáh už hrozí útokem i Kypru, členské zemi EU\n\nŠéf Hizballáhu Hasan Sajjíd Nasralláh varoval, že pokud Izrael zaútočí na jeho pozice v Libanonu, rozpoutá neomezenou válku. Dokonce pohrozil, že terčem jeho útoků se může stát i Kypr, který má s Izraelem dvoustrannou obrannou dohodu a obě země podnikají společná vojenská cvičení. Jako jeden z možných cílů v Izraeli pak zmínil základnu na hoře Meron na severu země.\n\n\n„Otevření kyperských letišť a základen izraelskému nepříteli, aby mohl cílit na Libanon, by mohlo znamenat, že kyperská vláda je součástí války a odpor s ní bude zacházet jako se součástí války,“ řekl Nasralláh podle listu The Guardian, přičemž slovem odpor mínil společnou frontu organizací napojených na Írán, kam patří kromě Hizballáhu i palestinský Hamás, jemenští Húsíové nebo několik šíitských milicí působících v Iráku.\n\nI když je v Nasralláhově vyjádření hodně podmínek, za kterých by se Kypr mohl stát terčem útoku Hizballáhu, například by Izrael musel k útoku použít jeho základny, jde o bezprecedentní výhrůžku ozbrojeným útokem na členskou zemi EU.\n\nReakce Kypru\n\nKyperský prezident Nikos Christodulides se snažil napětí mírnit: „Taková vyjádření nejsou potěšující, ale neodrážejí realitu. Kypr zůstává neangažovaný v jakýchkoli vojenských konfliktech a jeho pozicí je být spíš součástí řešení než problému.“\n\nZmínil také, že země hraje velkou roli při zajišťování humanitární pomoci pro Pásmo Gazy. Umožnil otevřít námořní koridor do pásma, jímž proudí pomoc po moři.\n\nEskalace napětí\n\nNasralláhova slova dále vyostřila eskalující se napětí mezi Izraelem i Hizballáhem. Šéf šíitské teroristické organizace reagoval na vyjádření velení izraelské armády, že plány pro operaci proti Hizballáhu jsou schválené a jednotky jsou v pohotovosti.\n\nIzrael tak reagoval jednak na zesilující se ostřelování Izraele z jihu Libanonu, ale také na zveřejnění záběrů Haify včetně vojenských zařízení, které natočily drony Hizballáhu.\n\nNasralláh v posledním projevu opakovaně hrozil Izraeli: „Máme více než sto tisíc bojovníků a v případě nejhoršího scénáře dokonce více. Připravili jsme se na nejhorší možný scénář a Izrael to ví. Od 8. října nepřítel chápe, že určitá místa mohou být terčem.“ Zmínil i záběry z Haify: „Vědí, že máme informace o těchto místech.“\n\n„V roce 2006 (kdy probíhala rozsáhlá letní válka Izraele s Hizballáhem – pozn. red.) jsme měli ambice bombardovat izraelskou základnu na hoře Meron. Dnes jsme právě řekli bojovníkům, aby to udělali, a to okamžitě. Ať už jsou naše záměry jakékoli, ať už chceme válku v plném rozsahu, nebo ne, nepřítel na severu země musí zůstat připraven,“ vyhrožuje Nasralláh s tím, že izraelské hrozby nemají na kalkulace Hizballáhu žádný vliv.\n\nDatum 8. října se odkazuje kde dni, kdy Izrael začal odpovídat na útoky teroristů z Hamásu a Islámského džihádu vedené na jih země z Pásma Gazy.\n\nPoslední plný vojenský střet Izraele a Libanonu se odehrál v létě roku 2006 poté, co Hizballáh vyprovokoval židovský stát k zásahu útoky na pohraniční obce a únosy vojáků.\n\nMasivní vojenský úder Izraele sice nepřinesl jednoznačný politický úspěch v podobě trvalé likvidace hrozby Hizballáhu, Libanonu ale způsobil decimující škody na infrastruktuře a hospodářství. Země se od té doby nedokázala plně vzpamatovat, stále se potácí na pokraji státního bankrotu, polovina obyvatelstva je pod hranicí chudoby, nefungují veřejné služby, zadlužení patří k nejvyšším na světě.\n"

Šéf izraelské vlády svůj příspěvek podle listu The Times of Israel (TOI) zveřejnil krátce po telefonátu s americkým prezidentem Joem Bidenem, který Netanjahua vyzval, aby se vojenská operace izraelské armády nerozšířila na Rafáh, dokud nebude zaručena bezpečnost civilistů. Netanjahu také uvedl, že odmítá jednostranné uznání palestinského státu.\n\n\n„Izrael kategoricky odmítá mezinárodní diktáty ohledně trvalého urovnání (vztahů) s Palestinci,“ uvedl Netanjahu. „Takové ujednání bude dosaženo pouze přímým jednáním mezi stranami bez předběžných podmínek,“ dodal.\n\nPodle Netanjahua Izrael také odmítá „jednostranné uznání palestinského státu“. „Takové uznání by v důsledku masakru ze 7. října poskytlo obrovskou odměnu bezprecedentnímu terorismu a zabránilo jakékoli budoucí mírové dohodě,“ uvedl dále v příspěvku.\n\nNetanjahu zveřejnil na sociálních sítí svůj příspěvek krátce poté, co jeho úřad oznámil, že mluvil zhruba 40 minut po telefonu s americkým prezidentem Joem Bidenem. Další detail úřad neuvedl.\n\nPodle zdroje z premiérovy kanceláře serveru The Times of Israel oba politici mluvili o pokračování bojů proti teroristickému hnutí Hamás v Pásmu Gazy, o možném pozemním útoku izraelské armády na město Rafáh, o osudu rukojmích či o humanitární situaci v Pásmu Gazy.\n\nBílý dům ve svém prohlášení potvrdil, že oba politici mluvili o jednáních, která se vedou o propuštění rukojmích. Do rozhovorů jsou přímo zapojené i Spojené státy.\n\n„Prezident (Biden) také nadnesl situaci v Rafáhu a zopakoval svůj názor, že vojenská operace by neměla pokračovat bez věrohodného a proveditelného plánu na zajištění bezpečnosti a pomoci civilistům v Rafáhu,“ uvedl Bílý dům v prohlášení. Do Rafáhu odešly stovky tisíc lidí, kteří uprchli před boji v dalších částech Pásma Gazy.\n\nAmeričtí vládní představitelé vyzývají Izrael, aby více dbal při svých úderech a vojenských operací v Pásmu Gazy na ochranu civilistů, a USA se také účastní jednání o propuštění rukojmí a pozastavení bojů.Izrael zahájil pozemní operaci v Pásmu Gazy v reakci na barbarský útok teroristického hnutí Hamás z loňského října. Při něm hnutí zavraždilo přes 1200 lidí, převážně civilistů, a dalších více než 260 uneslo.\n\nV současné době Hamás stále zadržuje přes 130 osob. Podle izraelských vojenských zdrojů je ale pravděpodobné, že nejméně 30 z nich již není naživu. Podle amerického listu The New York Times by ale zabitých rukojmích mohlo být až padesát. Armáda v pondělí rovněž oznámila, že bezpečnostní složky se budou i nadále snažit dostat zajatce domů „všemi prostředky“.\n\n\n\n"

Do tábora v centrální části pásma se rodina uchýlila po výzvě izraelského premiéra Benjamina Netanjahua, aby lidé opustili sever Pásma Gazy a odešli na jih území.\n\n\n„Nevybíravý útok izraelských okupačních sil vyústil v tragickou ztrátu ženy, syna a dcery (Dáduha), zatímco zbytek jeho rodiny je pohřbený pod troskami,“ uvedla stanice ve svém vyjádření, přičemž oběti označila za mučedníky.\n\nVnuk Adam podle Al-Džazíry zemřel po dvou hodinách na následky zranění. Novorozená vnučka a několik další lidí přežilo, další syn, Jahja, ale utrpěl zranění hlavy a musel být okamžitě ošetřován na chodbě přeplněné nemocnice. Na šití nebyly ani vhodné nástroje.\n\nTelevize zveřejnila záběry plačícího novináře nad tělem 15letého syna Mahmúda v nemocnici Mučedníků od Al-Aksá v Dajr Balahu. Na dalším snímku je s dětským tělem v náručí.\n\n„Co se stalo, je jasné. Je to série útoků zaměřených na děti, ženy a civilisty,“ řekl Dáduh z nemocnice. „Právě jsem podával zprávu o takovémto útoku z Jarmúku. Izraelské nálety mířily na mnoho oblastí včetně Nusajratu,“ dodal.\n\nKatarská televize uvedla, že výbuch byl důsledkem izraelského náletu, ale nijak to nedoložila, poznamenala stanice CNN. Izrael na dotaz CNN, zda v místě útočilo jeho letectvo, neodpověděl.\n\nRodina Dáduha se přesunula do tábora Nusajrat z Tal Hawy v samotném městě Gaza, protože tábor považovala za bezpečnější. „Toto je ,bezpečná‘ oblast, o které mluvila okupační armáda,“ řekl Dáduh, přičemž izraelské síly označil za okupační armádu, i když Pásmo Gazy neokupují.\n\n\n\n"

Reaktor Novinek Alex Švamberk a bezpečnostní expert Milan Mikulecký ve zvláštním dílu podcastu Zbytečná válka probírali pozadí a dopady konfliktu.\n\n\nZbytečná válka: Speciál\n\nMikulecký podotkl, že sice útoky Húsíů na lodě rada bezpečnosti odsoudila, ale její rezoluce nedala mandát k útoku na Húsíe: „Bohužel se nepodařilo získat mandát pro vojenské nasazení. Že USA a Británie zasáhly, vyplývá z jiných mezinárodních norem a dohod na právo svobodné plavby a boj proti pirátství.“\n\nMikulecký zdůraznil, že Húsíové nejsou žádní bosí bojovníci s kalašnikovem, ale mají k dispozici vyspělé íránské zbraně včetně balistických raket a protilodních střel. Mluví se o nich jako o povstalcích, ve skutečnosti jde ale o proxy válku mezi dvěma regionálními mocnostmi - šíitským Íránem, podporujícím Húsíe, a Saúdskou Arábií, jež podporuje sunnity.\n\nZapojení Íránu a jeho revolučních gard\n\n„Poslední konflikt se rozhořel v roce 2014 po nešťastném arabském jaru, kterým si Západ rozvrátil celý Blízký východ, a za to teďka sklízíme odměnu v podobě milionů migrantů. Došlo k vypuknutí občanské války, do které se ihned zapojil Írán. A protože Saúdská Arábie se začala oprávněně obávat o svoji bezpečnost, protože žádné dohody, které byly mezi Húsíi a legitimní jemenskou vládou uzavřeny, nebyly nikdy naplněny, tak se do té občanské války vložila koalice vedená Saúdskou Arábií, která zahrnovala některé další sunnitské země z oblasti Arabského zálivu, ale i Egypt,“ řekl Mikulecký.\n\nAnalytik připomněl, že zapojení Íránu rostlo: „Na území Jemenu, které hnutí kontroluje, operují íránské revoluční gardy. Írán začal zásobovat Húsie i svoje jednotky skutečně sofistikovanými zbraněmi a začal ostřelovat Saúdskou Arábii a Spojené arabské emiráty.“\n\nSaúdská Arábie se sice loni pokusila uzavřít mírovou dohodu s Húsií, ale dosud k tomu nedošlo. Situace se pak přiostřila po teroristickém útoku Hamásu na Izrael. Když na ni Izrael odpověděl, začali Húsíové odpalovat střely s plochou dráhou letu na Izrael a také ostřelovat lodě v průlivu Báb al-Mandáb, což je vstup do Rudého moře z Indického oceánu, kudy prochází 15 procent světového obchodu.\n\nPomoc Palestincům jako zástěrka\n\n„Útoky na lodě samozřejmě nemají s Palestinci vůbec nic společného, to jsou kecy,“ uvedl Mikulecký.\n\nÍrán se takto snaží zasahovat Západ. Pokud lodě nemohou plout do Evropy z Asie Rudým mořem, cesta se prodlužuje o dva týdny. To znamená nejen vyšší náklady, a tedy zdržení, ale hlavně se přestává dostávat lodního prostoru. Přes Rudé moře se přitom z Asie dovážejí nejen trička z Pákistánu a Bangladéše, ale také léky z Indie, ocel z Číny a čipy z asijských zemí.\n\n„Jedna z továren firmy Tesla v Německu musela pozastavit výrobu, protože právě kvůli krizi v průlivu Báb al-Mandáb neodstává součástky, které jsou nezbytné ke smontování auta,“ zmínil analytik.\n\nVydávat útoky za podporu Palestinců má jiný efekt: „Írán tím zavřel arabským zemím v regionu dveře pro nějakou větší akci, kdyby Egypt teď začal bojovat proti Húsíům, tak se dostane pod tlak vlastní arabské ulice.“\n\nMikulecký se nejvíce obává právě dopadu útoků na lodě na Egypt, protože tím přichází o příjmy z tranzitu lodí: „Jakákoliv nestabilita může znamenat, že se zvednou skupiny nelegálních migrantů, kteří v případě, že ekonomická situace v Egyptě nebude dobrá, zamíří do Evropy.“\n\nMikulecký také uvedl, že reakce na útoky ukazuje, že vzniká nová osa zla tvořená Íránem, Hizballáhem, Severní Koreou, možná Sýrií a somálskými piráty. Švamberk upozornil, že tato koalice ale nemá žádné jednotné řízení z Moskvy nebo z Pekingu, protože všichni sledují své vlastní zájmy, i když je spojuje nenávist k Západu a USA.\n\n„Stabilita by byla v zájmu Číny, která do oblasti nedávno poslala na zdvořilostní návštěvu flotilu, protože čínská ekonomika na tom není dobře. Po realitním trhu má teďka velké problémy bankovní sektor v Číně. Čína dlouhou dobu investovala hodně peněz a úsilí do té nové Hedvábné stezky, která měla jít právě taky přes Jemen,“ uvedl Mikulecký k postoji Číny.\n\nboxík podcast Zbytečná válka - final\n\nNepravidelný podcast, který nabízí nejrůznější pohledy na válečný konflikt na Ukrajině a další současné konflikty.

OSN varuje, že lidem v Gaze kvůli váznoucí pomoci hrozí hladomor.\n\n\n„Při pohledu ze vzduchu Gaza změnila barvu (…) Je to teď úplně jiné území.“ Tak charakterizoval podle katarské televize al-Džazíra destrukci v Pásmu Gazy Corey Scher, kartografický expert z Oregonské státní univerzity. Jeho tým porovnal snímky poskytnuté satelity programu Copernicus a došel k závěru, že v severní části Pásma Gazy zničily izraelské nálety a pozemní útoky dvě třetiny všech budov.\n\nVe městě Chán Júnis na jihu Pásma Gazy, kam se v posledních dnech izraelské útoky soustřeďují, je podle stejného zdroje zničena čtvrtina všech nadzemních objektů.\n\nPalestinské úřady i řada zejména arabských zemí viní Izrael z toho, že cíleně ničí infrastrukturu v Pásmu Gazy tak, aby se obyvatelé po skončení války neměli kam vrátit a nakonec museli odejít jinam. Nuceně vysídleno již v rámci Pásma Gazy bylo asi 90 procent populace čítající více než 2 miliony lidí. Izrael nálety i pozemní útoky ospravedlňuje nutností zničit hnutí Hamás.\n\nOSN: Gazanům akutně hrozí hlad\n\nÚřad pro koordinaci humanitárních záležitostí OSN (UNOCHA) uvedl, že obyvatelstvu Pásma Gazy akutně hrozí hladomor. Úřad uvádí „bezprecedentně vysoký podíl populace, která je v ohrožení v důsledku nedostatku potravin“.\n\nOd začátku násilností, které spustil útok Hamásu na Izrael dne 7. října, se do Pásma Gazy dostává jen omezené množství humanitární pomoci. Všechny kamiony, které tam míří, na přechodu Rafáh detailně prověřují izraelské úřady, což přísun zdržuje.\n\nV Pásmu Gazy od začátku války zahynulo podle tamních úřadů přes 20 000 lidí, zraněných je přes 50 000. Jen za posledních 48 hodin zabily izraelské útoky podle stejného zdroje 390 lidí. Údaje nelze nezávisle ověřit.\n\nÚtok Hamásu na Izrael dne 7. října, který aktuální kolo násilností spustil, připravil o život podle úřadů židovského státu asi 1200 osob.\n\n\n\n"

Dai zveřejňoval posty, kde hrozil Židům na školní půdě proříznutím hrdla, setnutím nebo znásilněním.\n\n\nDai podle federálního trestního oznámení zveřejnil „výhružné vzkazy včetně příspěvků vyzývajících ke smrti židovských studentů“ na diskusním webu v sekci věnované Cornellově univerzitě.\n\nVzkazy, jež měly být podepsané nickem Hamas, se objevily o víkendu, uvedla BBC. Hrozba se týkala třeba košer jídelny v kampusu, jež se nachází hned vedle židovského střediska. Jídelnu a středisko musela střežit policie.\n\n„V dalším příspěvku Dai zřejmě vyhrožoval, že zapíchne a prořízne hrdla všem židovským mužům, které uvidí na akademické půdě, že znásilní a shodí z útesu jakékoli židovské ženy a setne hlavu všem židovským malým dětem,“ stojí ve vyjádření žaloby podle webu Insider.\n\nVe stejném příspěvku měl Dai vyhrožovat, že do kampusu přinese útočnou pušku a zastřelí „všechna židovská prasata“.

        "content": "The text to analyze is: Netanjahu odmítl požadavky Hamásu. Jediné řešení je vítězství, prohlásil\n\nIzraelský premiér Benjamin Netanjahu ve středu večer odmítl požadavky teroristického hnutí Hamás ohledně příměří v Pásmu Gazy a propuštění rukojmích zajatých při útoku v říjnu 2023. Za jediné řešení označil izraelské vítězství.\n\n\n„Jsme na cestě k absolutnímu vítězství. Vítězství je na dosah,“ řekl Netanjahu s tím, že se Izraeli válku podaří vyhrát v řádu měsíců, uvedl web The Times of Israel (ToI).\n\nHamás v úterní odpovědi na zprostředkovaný návrh další dohody s Izraelem předložil vlastní plán příměří, které by trvalo ve třech fázích celkem čtyři a půl měsíce. Během nich by Hamás propustil všechny zbývající rukojmí výměnou za palestinské vězně, izraelské síly by se stáhly z Pásma Gazy a byla by uzavřena dohoda o ukončení války.\n\nJeště před vyjádřením premiéra Netanjahu ale bylo jasné, že Izrael na požadavky Hamásu na ukončení války a propuštění vězňů nepřistoupí.\n\nPředseda izraelské vlády také zopakoval, že izraelským cílem v konfliktu je zničit Hamás, osvobodit rukojmí a zajistit, aby Pásmo Gazy už pro Izrael nepředstavovalo hrozbu. Jakoukoli dohodu, která by ponechala Hamásu plnou nebo částečnou kontrolu nad Pásmem Gazy, Netanjahu vyloučil.\n\nIzrael je podle něj „jedinou mocností“ schopnou dlouhodobě zajistit bezpečnost. Premiér také vyzval k nahrazení agentury OSN pro palestinské uprchlíky UNRWA, která čelí izraelskému obvinění, že se její zaměstnanci podíleli na říjnových teroristických útocích Hamásu na Izrael.\n\nNetanjahu dále vyjádřil přesvědčení, že Izraeli se po porážce Hamásu podaří uzavřít mírové dohody s dalšími arabskými státy. Saúdská Arábie, o níž jde izraelskému premiérovi především, však již dříve podmínila navázání vztahů s Izraelem ukončením války v Pásmu Gazy a uznáním nezávislého palestinského státu.\n\nIzrael v Pásmu Gazy vede válku Hamásu, který USA i EU označují za teroristické a které loni 7. října provedlo masivní přeshraniční útok na Izrael, při němž zahynulo 1200 lidí. Dalších asi 250 osob palestinští ozbrojenci unesli do Pásma Gazy, zhruba stovku z nich propustili během dosud jediného příměří na konci listopadu.\n\nIzraelská odveta si podle středeční bilance úřadů ovládaných Hamásem za čtyři měsíce bojů vyžádala životy nejméně 27 708 Palestinců. Tyto údaje však nelze ověřit a zahrnují také zabité bojovníky Hamásu a jiných teroristických skupin.\n\n"

Podle izraelské armády se mohlo jednat o dronový útok, který ovšem nespustil ve městě sirény. Informuje o tom agentura Reuters.

Incident je důkladně prověřován,“ uvedla izraelská armáda v prohlášení, na které odkazuje agentura Reuters.\n\n„Na místo dorazilo velké množství policistů a pyrotechniků, kteří se situací zabývají,“ uvedla policie ve zprávě bez dalších podrobností.\n\nIzraelský deník Ha'arec ve svém on-line přenosu uvedl, že na místě zemřel jeden člověk. Podle záchranných složek se jednalo o muže, kterého zasáhla troska dronu. Několik dalších bylo zraněno poblíž americké ambasády. Výbuch se ozval ve 3:15 místního času (2:15 SELČ) jen několik metrů od ní.\n\nPodle listu The Times of Israel je celkový počet zraněných osm. Všichni byli převezeni do nemocnice, čtyři z nich byli zasaženi dronem a další čtyři lidé byli v šoku. Na sociálních sítích a v izraelských médiích se objevila videa zachycující výbuch, jemuž těsně předchází svištivý zvuk.\n\nK útoku se později přihlásili Húsíové. „Vojenská operace, jejíž podrobnosti oznámíme, byla zaměřena na Tel Aviv,“ uvedl bez dalších podrobností mluvčí povstalců na síti X.\n\n\n"

Jen pro silné žaludky, zákaz nahrávání\n\nIzraelská vláda v pondělí dopoledne pořádá pro vybrané novináře promítání videomateriálu pocházejícího z kamer umístěných na tělech teroristů z Hamásu, kteří si při útoku 7. října své vražedné počínání natáčeli. Izraelce k tomuto kroku vede rostoucí míra zpochybňování rozsahu bezprecedentního masakru, při němž bylo povražděno přes 1400 lidí, většinou civilistů.\n\n\n„Bohužel, a nechápu, že to vůbec musím říct a že to jako země vůbec musíme dělat, jsme k tomuto kroku museli přistoupit. Zatímco se snažíme zastavit teroristy, zažíváme popírání toho, co se stalo, podobně, jako je tomu s holokaustem. A děje se to čím dál víc,“ řekl v neděli večer na tiskovém brífinku mluvčí izraelské vlády Ejlon Levy.\n\n„Od 7. října shromažďujeme záběry z řádění teroristů, při kterém zmasakrovali každého, koho potkali,“ řekl mluvčí. Záběry z kamer dokumentující vraždy a mučení budou podle něj promítnuty surové a nesestříhané novinářům, kteří mají podle Levyho „žaludek na otřesnou pravdu“.\n\n„Lidé zpochybňují rozsah zvěrstev, které Hamás spáchal na našem lidu. Někteří z teroristů si to ale zaznamenali, aby násilí mohli později oslavit,“ uvedl dále Levy k záběrům, které podle něj ještě nikdo neviděl.\n\nIzraelská vláda chce tyto záznamy promítnout novinářům, aby mohli v plné míře pochopit, k jak hrůzným činům došlo. Budou je však moci čtenářům zprostředkovat jen v písemné formě. Podle pozvánky, kterou pro novináře vydalo tiskové centrum kanceláře premiéra, nebude povoleno promítání natáčet a všichni budou muset odevzdat své mobily či fotoaparáty. Izraelci tak chtějí zabránit pořizování dalších kopií, jež by následně kolovaly po internetu.\n\nTeroristé Hamásu vnikli na území Státu Izrael v sobotu 7. října ráno a při bezprecedentním pogromu zmasakrovali více než 1400 lidí, většinou civilistů. Izraelská armáda v reakci na tato zvěrstva zahájila mohutné letecké ostřelování Pásma Gazy, které má připravit půdu pro pozemní operaci. Jejím cílem je kompletně zničit struktury teroristického hnutí Hamás, jež v Gaze vládne neomezeně od roku 2006, kdy vyhrálo první a od té doby i poslední volby. Izrael se z území kompletně stáhl o rok dříve.\n\nHamás tvrdí, že izraelské nálety na Gazu si vyžádaly již přes 4600 mrtvých. Tyto zprávy vyvolávají po celém světě demonstrace na podporu Palestinců. Avšak spolu s nimi rostou i útoky na Židy ve městech západní Evropy a také v USA. U antisemitských incidentů figurují nejen lidé pocházející z arabských či muslimských zemí, ale paradoxně i stoupenci progresivní levice.\n\n"

Veřejné popravě přihlížel dav palestinských civilistů, mnozí z nich si událost natáčeli na mobilní telefony.\n\nJedním ze zabitých mužů byl jednatřicetiletý Hamza Ahmad Hamza Mubárak a druhým devětadvacetiletý Azzám Džamál Háfiz Džavabra. Mubárak pocházel přímo z Tulkarmu, ve kterém k popravě došlo, zatímco Džavabra byl obyvatelem Džanínu. Těla obou mužů následně podle snímků skončila v kontejneru s odpadem.\n\nPalestinský reportér Júnis Tiráví na svém účtu na sociální síti X informoval, že popravě přihlížely stovky lidí. Upozornil také na chybějící zásah Palestinské samosprávy. „K incidentu došlo před hodinou a na ulici stále nejsou žádné bezpečnostní síly Palestinské samosprávy,“ napsal na X v pátek pozdě večer.\n\nPodle zpráv z místa byly veřejné popravy zorganizovány příslušníky Hamásu, který se na Západním břehu ovládaném Palestinskou samosprávou těší rostoucí popularitě.\n\nIzrael: Už to v OSN odsoudili?\n\n„Hrůzné zprávy o tom, že Hamás veřejně popravil dva Palestince na Západním břehu. Už jste někdo viděl odsouzení od agentur OSN a zástupců lidskoprávního průmyslu, kteří jsou v této válce spojenci Hamásu?“ komentoval událost mluvčí izraelské vlády Ejlon Levy.\n\nIzrael se nyní nachází ve válce s Hamásem, který vládne v Pásmu Gazy. Od pátečního rána tam platí čtyřdenní klid zbraní, na němž se dohodli zástupci obou stran konfliktu. Příměří má být využito k postupnému propouštění rukojmích, které teroristé z Hamásu zavlekli do Pásma Gazy. Izraelci na oplátku propouští z věznic palestinské vězně odsouzené za různé násilné činy. Při útoku Hamásu na jižní Izrael ze 7. října bylo do Pásma Gazy zavlečeno zhruba 240 lidí. Dalších 1200 lidí přišlo o život.\n\nNásledná izraelská vojenská operace v Gaze, která má za cíl zničit struktury Hamásu, si podle zástupců teroristického hnutí vyžádala kolem 15 000 životů. Izrael čelí tlaku na zastavení akce. Izraelci upozorňují na to, že Hamás zneužívá civilisty jako živé štíty, a stěžují si na to, že proti nim OSN a lidskoprávní aktivisté uplatňují dvojí metr, když nezmiňují barbarské činy z palestinské strany.\n\n\n\n"

Zatkli ho\n\nBývalého činitele americké Národní bezpečnostní rady z éry prezidenta Baracka Obamy zatkla newyorská policie. Stuart Seldowitz byl předběžně obviněn z nenávistného stalkingu a obtěžování poté, co se na sociálních sítích objevila série videí, na nichž slovně útočí na muslimského prodavače v New Yorku, podotkla stanice CNN. Muž na záběrech mimo jiné s úsměvem mluví o zabíjení palestinských dětí a vysmívá se islámu.\n\n\nVe zveřejněných videích, jejichž autenticitu potvrdil sám Seldowitz, muž prodejci občerstvení vyčítá podporu teroristického hnutí Hamás a odkazuje na probíhající konflikt mezi Izraelem a tímto palestinským teroristickým hnutím.\n\n„Podporujete zabíjení malých dětí,“ říká Seldowitz prodejci v jednom videu. „Vy zabíjíte děti, ne já,“ odvětí mu muž. „I kdybychom zabili 4000 palestinských dětí, tak víš co? Pořád to není dost!“ reaguje někdejší činitel americké diplomacie.\n\nZveřejněná videa pocházejí z několika dní, Seldowitz totiž za prodejcem chodil opakovaně.\n\n„Dáme sem velké cedule oznamující, že tenhle chlápek podporuje Hamás,“ říká muži Seldowitz na jednom ze záběrů. Později řekl, že konfrontaci odstartovala právě prvotní konverzace, během níž prodejce vyjádřil podporu Hamásu.\n\nV dalším videu se Seldowitz muže ptá, zda zná egyptskou tajnou službu, známou jako Muchabarat.\n\n„Muchabarat v Egyptě dostane tvoje rodiče. Má tvůj otec rád svoje nehty? Vyrvou mu je jeden po druhém,“ pokračuje někdejší americký činitel, načež proti prodejci zvedá svůj telefon. „Usměj se,“ dodává.\n\nSeldowitz se také na záběrech vysmívá islámu. „Znásilnil jsi svou dceru jako Mohammed?“ doráží mimo jiné na prodejce.\n\n„Celé té věci lituji a omlouvám se. Nechal jsem se unést a řekl jsem věci, které jsem asi říkat neměl,“ řekl pak Seldowitz newyorskému webu City & State ještě před svým zatčením.\n\nSeldowitz stál v čele Národní bezpečnostní rady pro jižní Asii mezi lety 2009 až 2011 během éry amerického prezidenta Baracka Obamy, býval také zástupcem amerického Úřadu pro Izrael a palestinské záležitosti.\n\nPozději pracoval pro lobbistickou firmu Gotham Goverment Relations, která jej však po incidentu propustila.\n\n„Video zachycující jeho činy je odporné, rasistické a pod důstojností standardů, které v naší firmě praktikujeme,“ vzkázala společnost. Její ředitel David Schwartz navíc prodejci nabídl bezplatné právní služby.\n\nSamotnému prodavači pak celý incident paradoxně přilákal větší počet zákazníků. Před jeho stánkem v New Yorku se tento týden začaly tvořit fronty těch, kteří jej přišli podpořit objednávkou.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "The text to analyze is: Stařenka vozila nemocné z Gazy do Izraele. Hamás ji zajal, zbil a teď propustil\n\nPětaosmdesátiletá Jocheved Lifšicová, kterou v pondělí večer propustilo ze zajetí palestinské hnutí Hamás, popsala, že ji 7. října při převozu do Pásma Gazy zbili holemi. Později během dvoutýdenního zajetí s ní ale prý zacházeli dobře. Křehce vypadající Lifšicová sedící na invalidním vozíku je podle rodiny aktivistkou, která před únosem vozila z Gazy těžce nemocné Palestince za léčbou do Izraele.\n\n\nLifšicová a její třiaosmdesátiletý manžel Oded byli odvlečeni ze svého domova v kibucu Nir Oz, muž přitom stále zůstává v palestinském zajetí.\n\n„Jsou to aktivisté za lidská práva, míroví aktivisté po celý svůj život,“ popsal pár jejich vnuk Daniel Lifšic agentuře Reuters.\n\n„Více než deset let vozili nemocné Palestince z Pásma Gazy každý týden od hraničního přechodu Erez do nemocnic v Izraeli, aby je tam léčili s rakovinou nebo jakoukoliv jinou nemocí,“ dodal.\n\nLifšicovou Hamás nakonec propustil v pondělí společně s 79letou Nurit Cooperovou, stále ale drží zhruba dalších 200 zajatců. Obě ženy byly 7. října uneseny z kibucu Nir Oz a jejich manželé jsou stále v Pásmu Gazy.\n\nVězení v podzemí\n\nLifšicová na tiskové konferenci z izraelské nemocnice mluvila hebrejsky a její dcera Šarone překládala pro anglickojazyčná média. Lifšicová uvedla, že si během únosu 7. října prošla peklem. Popsala, jak ji na motorce unesli ozbrojenci, kteří ji bili holemi, a uvedla, že se jí po cestě špatně dýchalo. Dodala, že izraelská vláda utratila miliardy za hraniční plot, ale nijak nezabránila Hamásu, aby ho překonal.\n\nLifšicová řekla, že jí únosci při převozu sundali hodinky a šperky. Popsala, že když sesedla z motorky, lidé, kteří ji přivítali, řekli, že „věří v korán“, a proto jí neublíží. Spolu s dalšími 24 lidmi ji pak odvedli do „obrovské sítě“ tunelů, která připomínala „pavučinu“ a půda v nich byla „měkká a vlhká“. Všichni byli nuceni ujít několik kilometrů pěšky a po dvou nebo třech hodinách bylo odděleno pět lidí z kibucu Nir Oz do samostatné místnosti.\n\nLifšicová pak popsala podmínky, v nichž byla ona a její spoluvězni drženi, jako čisté. Řekla, že spali na matracích na podlaze v tunelech pod Gazou a každé dva až tři dny je přišel navštívit lékař. Jeden ze zajatců, který se cestou do Gazy těžce zranil při nehodě na motorce, byl ošetřen. Lifšicová dodala, že zdravotník jim také přinesl potřebné léky.\n\nPostarší žena také uvedla, že v její skupině byl na každého z pěti držených rukojmích jeden strážný. Její únosci se podle ní „postarali o každý detail“ - včetně žen, které věděly o „ženské hygieně“.\n\nChce pomoct s osvobozením dalších\n\nPodle Lifšicové její skupina dostávala v tunelech k jídlu sýr a okurku. Její dcera Šarone dodala, že to bylo stejné jídlo, které jedli jejich věznitelé. S odkazem na další rukojmí zajaté Hamásem řekla, že podle její matky „příběh neskončí, dokud se všichni nevrátí“.\n\nŠarone před tiskovou konferencí řekla stanici BBC, že prioritou její matky je pomoc ostatním rukojmím, a je proto ochotná předávat informace, které by mohly vést k osvobození dalších lidí. Šarone také uvedla, že její matka a otec, který byl rovněž unesen a nebyl propuštěn, nebyli spolu, když je ozbrojenci odvlekli. „Nebyl s mojí matkou, takže neví, kde je,“ řekla BBC.\n\nDůvody k propuštění obou starších žen byly podle mluvčího ozbrojeného křídla Hamásu humanitární a zdravotní. Minulý týden Hamás ze zajetí propustil dvě Američanky - Judith Raananovou a její dceru Natalii. Významnou roli v jejich propuštění sehrál Katar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

It takes into account international responses to the conflict, both political (diplomatic statements, protests and calls for action by the global community) and civic (demonstrations in support of Israel or Palestine, discussions on academic campuses).

        "content": "The text to analyze is: Izrael: Zabili jsme již více než 7000 ozbrojenců\n\nIzraelská armáda od počátku války v Gaze zabila již nejméně sedm tisíc palestinských ozbrojenců. V sobotu to uvedl izraelský poradce pro národní bezpečnost. Teroristické hnutí Hamás dříve uvedlo, že v Gaze přišlo o život již 17 700 lidí a 48 780 jich bylo zraněno. Čísla však nelze nezávisle ověřit, navíc Hamás nerozlišuje civilisty a ozbrojence.\n\n\nHamás, který ovládá Gazu od roku 2007, odhaduje, že skutečný počet mrtvých a zraněných je mnohem vyšší, protože palestinské záchranné služby a zahraniční nevládní organizace nejsou schopné se dostat do všech bombardovaných oblastí, aby dostaly oběti z trosek.\n\nIzraelský velvyslanec při OSN Gilad Erdan už v pátek na jednání Rady bezpečnosti OSN naopak prohlásil, že Hamás počty obětí záměrně nadsazuje, aby mezinárodní společenství vyvíjelo na Izrael větší tlak.\n\nHlavním cílem izraelské ofenzivy posledních dní je město Chán Júnis, kde se podle Izraelců ukrývá člen vedení Hamásu Jahjá Sinvár. Tomu Izrael přičítá zosnování brutálního útoku na jih Izraele 7. října. Izrael dnes nařídil obyvatelům centra města, aby se urychleně evakuovali, a zahájil palbu po celé délce enklávy.\n\nOd minulého týdne, kdy skončilo příměří, Izrael rozšířil pozemní boje do jižní poloviny pásma Gazy a zahájil útok právě na Chán Júnis. Současně obě strany informují o rostoucí intenzitě bojů i na severu.\n\nNemocnice na jihu země hlásily za posledních 24 hodin 133 mrtvých a 259 zraněných. Další tisíce lidí se pohřešují a jsou považováni za mrtvé. V severní polovině oblasti přestaly fungovat nemocnice; a sanitky se často již nemohou dostat ke zraněným.\n\nCílem izraelské vojenské operace je zničení hnutí Hamás, které v sobotu 7. října zaútočilo na jihu Izraele, podle údajů izraelských úřadů tehdy zemřelo přes 1200 lidí. Dalších 240 lidí palestinští ozbrojenci unesli, část rukojmích však Hamás propustil během příměří, jež platilo od 24 listopadu do 1. prosince.\n\nNáčelník generálního štábu izraelské armády Herci Halevi dnes prohlásil, že existují známky rozpadu systému Hamásu v Gaze. To je podle něj znamením, že v konfliktu je třeba dál „přitlačit“.\n\nNaprostá většina z 2,3 milionu obyvatel Gazy již byla nucena opustit své domovy. Boje zuří po celém území a obyvatelé i zástupci OSN tvrdí, že nyní již vlastně není kam bezpečně jít, i když Izrael toto tvrzení zpochybňuje.\n\nNáměstek ředitele organizace OSN Světový potravinový program (WFP) Carl Skau agentuře Reuters řekl, že devět z deseti lidí na palestinském území nemůže každý den jíst. Polovina obyvatel hladoví. Vzhledem k tomu, že na celém zemí pokračují boje, dostává se tam jen zlomek potřebných potravin a podmínky na místě téměř znemožňují dodávky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

V noci z pátku na sobotu odpálili balistickou raketu na ropný tanker v Rudém moři a poškodili ho. Tanker Wind vlastněný řeckou společností plul pod vlajkou Panamy.\n\n\n„Přibližně v 1:00 jemenského času (24:00 SEČ) v sobotu odpálili Húsíové podporovaní Íránem jednu protilodní balistickou střelu (ASBM) do Rudého moře a zasáhli ropný tanker Wind,“ napsalo na síti X regionálního velení americké armády CENTCOM.\n\n„Zásah ASBM způsobil zaplavení, které mělo za následek ztrátu pohonu a řízení,“ uvedl CENTCOM s tím, že na nouzové volání okamžitě zareagovalo koaliční plavidlo. Pomoc však nakonec nebyla potřeba. „Posádce se podařilo obnovit pohon a řízení a nebyly hlášeny žádné oběti. Wind obnovil kurz vlastní silou,“ uvedl CENTCOM.\n\nTanker podle něj naposledy kotvil v Rusku a mířil do Číny. „Čína i Rusko udržují vztahy ohledně vojenského vybavení a ropy s Íránem, hlavním dobrodincem Húsíů,“ napsal k tomu web CBS News.\n\nPodle něj potvrdilo útok také britské vojenské operační středisko námořního obchodu a soukromá bezpečnostní společnost Ambrey. Podle ní raketa způsobila na palubě Wind požár. Húsíové se k útoku zatím nepřihlásili.\n\nHúsíové tvrdí, že jejich útoky jsou protestem proti válce Izraele s Hamásem a proti americké podpoře Izraele. Američtí představitelé však poukazují na to, že mnoho zasažených lodí, na které se skupina zaměřila, nemá s Izraelem žádné spojení.\n\n„Útoky Húsíů v posledních týdnech ustoupily, když se rebelové stali terčem náletu vedeného USA v Jemenu,“ připomněl web CBS News. Koalice vedená USA počátkem března provedla čtyři kola obranných úderů v Jemenu, v oblasti ovládané povstalci. Americká armáda navíc pravidelně provádí sebeobranné útoky proti raketám a dronům Húsíů, když vidí, že se připravují k útoku, píše CBS News s tím, že lodní doprava přes Rudé moře a Adenský záliv však zůstává kvůli hrozbě stále nízká.\n\n\n"

Na akci se jeden z přítomných polil hořlavinou a pokoušel se zapálit. Díky rychlému zásahu policistů se mu to nepovedlo, uvedla policie.\n\n\n„V rámci ohlášeného shromáždění v Praze 6 se jeden z účastníků polil hořlavinou a pokusil se zapálit. Díky rychlému zákroku dohlížejících policistů se mu to však nepovedlo. Incidentem se budou zabývat kriminalisté z odboru extremismu a terorismu a muž byl předán záchranné službě k ošetření,“ napsala policie na svém účtu na síti X.\n\nPodle informací Novinek se účastník demonstrace pokusil zapálit zapalovačem. Ten ale podle očitých svědků selhal a dotyčného ihned zpacifikovali přítomní policisté.\n\nCelou věcí se policie i nadále zabývá.\n\nPodle některých svědectví muž nepatřil k demonstrantům. „Ten muž podle mého názoru nebyl účastníkem demonstrace. V jednu chvíli přišel a svlékl si bundu. V ruce držel zelený hadr, který byl cítit ředidlem nebo něčím podobným. Ani ne za minutu už ho pacifikovali policisté. Vypadal, že není úplně v pořádku, připadalo mi, jako by byl pod vlivem nějaké látky,“ popsala Novinkám situaci mladá žena, která se protestu účastnila.\n\nV Badeniho ulici v Praze se odpoledne sešla zhruba stovka příznivců Palestiny, která poblíž izraelské ambasády demonstrovala proti izraelským vojenským akcím v Pásmu Gazy.\n\nPo celou dobu na akci dohlíželi policisté, včetně antikonfliktního týmu. Kromě zmíněného incidentu museli řešit jen drobné výstřelky několika kolemjdoucích, kterým se demonstrace nelíbila.\n\nNa opačné straně ulice se sešlo několik příznivců Izraele. K žádným vzájemným konfliktům ale nedošlo.\n\n"

Loď podle něho provede „závažné masakry“ v Pásmu Gazy, odkud v sobotu bojovníci radikálního palestinského hnutí Hamás podnikli překvapivý útok na izraelské území.\n\n\n„Co bude americká letadlová loď dělat blízko Izraele, proč přijíždějí? Co lodě kolem ní a letadla na ní budou dělat? Zaútočí na Gazu a okolí a podniknou kroky k zásadním masakrům,“ řekl Erdogan na tiskové konferenci s rakouským kancléřem Karlem Nehammerem.\n\nUž dříve dal turecký prezident najevo, že je připraven zhostit se zprostředkovatelské role mezi Izraelci a Palestinci, aby zajistil klid.\n\nBez vody, elektřiny, potravin a léků\n\nErdogan také kritizoval Izrael kvůli naprosté blokádě Pásma Gazy. Tu v pondělí oznámilo izraelské vedení v reakci na útoky Hamásu, které si vyžádaly životy více než 1000 Izraelců. „Nyní nejsou dodávky vody do Gazy, nejsou dodávky elektrického proudu. A co lidská práva?“ řekl Erdogan.\n\nZástupce Organizace pro osvobození Palestiny navíc oznámil, že Izrael odmítl žádost o umožnění dodávek potravin a léků do enklávy, a vyzval mezinárodní společenství k intervenci.\n\nTurecko-izraelské vztahy se zhoršily začátkem tohoto století poté, co se v Turecku dostal Erdogan k moci, nejprve jako premiér, poté jako prezident. Erdogan prosazoval politiku nakloněnou Palestincům.\n\nAmeričanům hrozí i Húsíové\n\nTurecko a Izrael za Erdoganovy vlády přerušily diplomatické vztahy v roce 2010 a obnovily je až po šesti letech. Znovu je přerušily v roce 2018 a plně obnovily loni.\n\nVůdce šíitských povstalců v Jemenu Abdal Málik Húsí v úterý varoval, že pokud by Spojené státy podnikly přímou intervenci v Gaze, Húsíové odpoví raketovými a dronovými útoky. „Pokud jde o Gazu, existují červené linie,“ řekl a dodal, že Húsíové jsou připraveni svůj postup koordinovat s dalšími skupinami.\n\nHúsíové jsou spojenci Íránu, úhlavního nepřítele Izraele.\n\n"

        "content": "The text to analyze is: Svět se po skandálu pracovníků - teroristů OSN obrací k Palestině zády\n\nUž téměř patnáct zemí pozastavilo financování úřadu OSN pro palestinské uprchlíky (UNRWA) v reakci na skandál, který rozkryl Stát Izrael. Nejméně 12 pracovníků úřadu mělo spolupracovat s teroristickým hnutím Hamás přímo na útoku na Izrael 7. října. Informuje o tom nevládní organizace UN Watch na svém webu, podle které je v současnosti pozastaveno zhruba 75 procent veškerých financí pro Palestinu.\n\n\nSvoji pomoc pozastavili tři největší dárci, mezi které s 344 miliony dolarů (téměř 7,9 miliard korun) patří Spojené státy americké, Německo s 202 miliony dolarů (přes 4,6 miliard korun) a Evropská unie se 114 miliony dolarů (přes 2,6 miliardy korun), uvádí s referencí na rok 2023 UN Watch na svém webu.\n\n„Spojené státy jsou velmi znepokojeny obviněním, že se dvanáct zaměstnanců UNRWA mohlo podílet na teroristickém útoku Hamásu na Izrael 7. října. Ministerstvo zahraničí dočasně pozastavilo další financování UNRWA, dokud tato obvinění a kroky, které OSN podniká k jejich vyřešení, nepřezkoumáme,“ stojí v prohlášení amerického ministerstva zahraničí.\n\nEvropská komise uvedla, že peníze nebude pro úřad pro palestinské uprchlíky posílat nejméně do konce února, píše agentura Reuters.\n\n„Na jednu stranu tu máme tato mimořádně závažná obvinění a je zřejmé, že je třeba je bezodkladně vyřešit. Na straně druhé je UNRWA partnerem pro humanitární pomoc Palestincům v Gaze a na Západním břehu Jordánu. Plně si uvědomujeme, že pomoc musí pokračovat,“ prohlásil tiskový mluvčí Evropské komise Eric Mamer.\n\nFinanční pomoc dále pozastavilo Japonsko, Francie, Švýcarsko, Kanada, Velká Británie, Nizozemsko, Rakousko, Finsko, Island, Rumunsko a Estonsko. „Estonsko nebude pokračovat ve financování této organizace. Vyzývám k rychlému a důkladnému prošetření těchto obvinění,“ uvedl na síti X estonský ministr zahraničí Margus Tsahkna.\n\nZejména u Islandu jde o poměrně překvapující zprávu, tato severská země dlouhodobě podporuje právo Palestinců na vlastní stát, v roce 2011 tato malá severská země jako první v západní Evropě uznala stát Palestina v jeho hranicích z roku 1967.\n\nKritika zastavení pomoci\n\nNe každý stát se však přidal k pozastavení finanční pomoci. Například Irsko uvedlo, že UNRWA poskytuje „životně důležitou pomoc 2,3 milionu lidí“. Norský ministr zahraničí Espen Barth Eide zase vyzval všechny ostatní dárce, aby zvážili širší důsledky snižování finančních prostředků uprostřed „rozsáhlého utrpení Palestinců“.\n\n„Neměli bychom kolektivně trestat miliony lidí. Musíme rozlišovat mezi tím, co mohli udělat jednotlivci, a tím, co UNRWA představuje,“ prohlásil Eide.\n\nProti zastavení pomoci se staví také Liga arabských států, která ve společném prohlášení 22 členských států z Blízkého východu a severní Afriky kritizovala snížení finančních prostředků.\n\nV roce 2018 tvořili arabští dárci čtvrtinu finančních prostředků UNRWA, v následujících letech však tato čísla klesala, což zhoršovalo finanční problémy agentury, píše deník Time.\n\nLoni v říjnu Spojené arabské emiráty agentuře věnovaly 20 milionů dolarů (asi 459 milionů korun). Další pomoc v hodnotě 2 milionu dolarů (asi 46 milionů korun) přislíbila i Saúdská Arábie. Kromě toho v říjnu Katarský fond pro rozvoj (QFFD) a UNRWA podepsaly víceletou dohodu v celkové výši 18 milionů dolarů (asi 413 milionů korun) na roky 2023 až 2024.\n\nSkandál UNRWAIzrael o víkendu ve spisu předložil Spojeným státům americkým důkazy o 12 pracovnících zapojených do útoku teroristů teroristického hnutí Hamás ze 7. října, kdy teroristé zavraždili přes 1200 Izraelců, převážně civilistů, a dalších více než 260 unesli. Přes 130 z nich se stále nachází v zajetí v Pásmu Gazy.\n\nDeník The New York Times, který měl možnost do spisu nahlédnout, uvedl, že se izraelským zpravodajským důstojníkům podařilo zjistit pohyb šesti pracovníků OSN na území židovského státu 7. října na základě jejich telefonů. Další tři se jim podařilo vystopovat díky telefonickým hovorům uvnitř Gazy, během nichž podle Izraelců diskutovali o svém zapojení do útoku Hamásu.\n\nZbylí pracovníci měli dostávat textové zprávy, ve kterých jim velení Hamásu nařizovalo, aby se 7. října dostavili na stanoviště teroristů. Jeden z nich měl podle spisu přinést raketové granáty uložené ve svém domě.\n\nIzraelci označili deset z těchto zaměstnanců za členy teroristického hnutí Hamás. Další měl být napojen na Palestinský islámský džihád, což je další teroristická skupina působící v Pásmu Gazy.\n\nSedm z obviněných prý bylo také učiteli ve školách UNRWA, kde vyučovali studenty například matematiku a arabštinu. Dva další pracovali ve školách v jiných funkcích. Zbývající tři byli popsáni jako úředník, sociální pracovník a vedoucí skladu.\n\nList NYT navíc uvedl, že pozastavení finanční pomoci může Gaza pocítit velmi rychle. Na rozdíl od jiných agentur OSN totiž nemá UNRWA žádnou strategickou finanční rezervu.\n\nJen špička ledovce?\n\nAmerický deník The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), který měl možnost do spisu nahlédnout, uvedl, že Izrael v dokumentu obvinil zhruba deset procent z celkového množství 12 tisíc zaměstnanců UNRWA, že mají vazby na teroristické hnutí Hamás nebo Palestinský islámský džihád.\n\n„Problém UNRWA nespočívá jen v několika špatných jedincích, kteří se podíleli na masakru ze 7. října,“ uvedl podle WSJ vysoce postavený izraelský vládní úředník. „Instituce jako celek je útočištěm radikální ideologie Hamásu,“ dodal.\n\nDva izraelští představitelé obeznámení se zpravodajskými informacemi uvedli, že zaměstnanci UNRWA, kteří byli považováni za osoby s vazbami na militantní skupiny, byli považováni za „operativce“, což znamená, že se aktivně podíleli na vojenském nebo politickém chodu organizace.\n\nWSJ dále uvádí, že 23 procent mužských zaměstnanců UNRWA mělo vazby na Hamás. Podle zpráv má v běžné populaci Pásma Gazy vazby na Hamás či Palestinský islámský džihád celkem 15 procent dospělých mužů. Tyto údaje svědčí o vyšší politizaci agentury než u obyvatelstva jako celku.\n\nTéměř polovina všech zaměstnanců UNRWA, odhadem 49 procent, měla rovněž blízké příbuzné, kteří měli oficiální vazby na militantní skupiny, zejména na Hamás, uvádí se ve zprávách zpravodajských služeb.\n\n\n\n"

Lidé, kteří oslavují vraždění nevinných civilistů. Kteří učí své děti nenávidět ostatní, protože jsou ‚nevěřící‘. Kteří chtějí zakázat ženám nosit sukně nebo kalhoty. Kteří pohrdají základním zákonem a místo toho poslouchají radikální kazatele. Kteří zneužívají toleranci, protože chtějí jinou společnost,“ pokračuje redakce německého listu.\n\nTa dále vyzvala německou společnost, aby se k těmto problémům postavila čelem a začala je řešit. „Německo musí nyní říct NE! Nenávisti k Židům, mizantropii a všem, kteří nám říkají NE,“ uvedla.\n\nDeník Bild dále zdůraznil, že v Německu je důstojnost každého člověka naprosto nedotknutelná. „Bez ohledu na to, jakou má barvu vlasů, jakým jazykem mluví a v co věří. To je to, co je třeba bránit!“ píše německý deník a dodává, že pokud Německo v tuhle chvíli klopýtne, tak padne.\n\nPadesátibodový manifest\n\nV návaznosti na tato silná slova proto Bild zformuloval padesátibodový manifest, který má představovat vůdčí myšlenku toho, co drží německou společnost pohromadě. „Text je určen všem žijícím lidem v Německu,“ vysvětluje. Některé body manifestu jsou:\n\nPro nás neexistují žádní nevěřící! Každý může věřit v to, co chce – dokonce i v Ježíška.Každý, kdo si myslí, že naše ústava a náš právní systém jsou sbírkou nezávazných rad, by měl Německo co nejdříve opustit.Každý, kdo u nás chce žít natrvalo, se musí naučit německy. Jen v případě, kdy všichni mluvíme stejným jazykem, si budeme rozumět.Každý může v Německu pokojně demonstrovat za své přesvědčení. Ke svobodnému vyjádření názoru nepatří vyhrožování nebo bití, házení kamenů, zapalování aut, oslavování vrahů.Na pozadí nejtemnějších kapitol našich dějin je bezpečnost Izraele německým státním zájmem! To znamená: Postavit se za bezpečnost židovského národa je neoddiskutovatelné. Kritika politiky Izraele je samozřejmě přípustná.Muži smějí milovat muže a ženy smějí milovat ženy. Ti, kteří s tím mají problém, jsou sami problémem. Milujte se a buďte sami milováni.Nepálíme vlajky zemí, které nemáme rádi. To je trestný čin!Ženy, které jsou nevěrné, nevyháníme a v žádném případě je nebijeme, nebo dokonce nekamenujeme.\nDemonstrace v Německu\n\n8. října, tedy jeden den po útoku teroristického hnutí Hamás na Izrael, vyšly do berlínských ulic desítky lidí, kteří útok teroristů oslavovali. V den útoku zase protiizraelská skupina Samidoun v Neuköllnu rozdávala kolemjdoucím baklavu na oslavu „vítězství odboje“.\n\nNěmecko posléze až do 17. října propalestinské demonstrace, kde je „s ohledem na konflikt na Blízkém východě důvodné podezření na antisemitský nebo extremistický obsah“, zakázalo.\n\nTo ovšem propalestinským demonstrantům nezabránilo 16. října demonstraci uspořádat. Tu sice německá policie rozpustila, ale až po několika hodinách, které provázelo házení různých předmětů, pepřové spreje a fyzické potyčky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Útok Hamásu na Izrael, při němž o víkendu zemřelo na 1200 lidí, odsoudil jako nejhorší pro Židy od doby holokaustu. O slovech Bidena pronesených v Bílém domě k představitelům židovské komunity informovaly agentury AP a Reuters.\n\n\n„Tento útok byl… čistou krutostí proti židovskému národu,“ řekl mimo jiné Biden, který si prý nikdy nemyslel, že se bude dozvídat o teroristech řezajících dětem hlavy. I takových masakrů se podle některých zpráv z Izraelepalestinští radikálové dopustili.\n\nAmerický prezident od začátku útoku v sobotu už čtyřikrát telefonicky hovořil s izraelským premiérem Benjaminem Netanjahuem, kterého opakovaně ujistil o podpoře USA a dodávkách zbraní pro izraelské protiútoky na Pásmo Gazy, z něhož Hamás zaútočil.\n\nSpojené státy už k Izraeli přesunuly i jednu ze svých letadlových lodí. „Přesunuli jsme flotilu kolem americké letadlové lodě do východního Středomoří a posíláme do tohoto regionu více stíhaček, čímž jsme Íráncům dali jasně najevo: ‚Buďte opatrní.‘“\n\nWashington sice nemá důkazy o tom, že by se Írán na útoku Hamásu podílel, ale opakovaně Teherán varoval, aby nezneužil situace, kdy bude izraelská pozornost zaměřena jinam. Írán, který neuznává právo Izraele na existenci, útok Hamásu přivítal.\n\nPrezident Íránu Ebráhím Raísí již o situaci jednal s korunním princem Saúdské Arábie Muhammadem bin Salmánem. Podle serveru BBC News to bylo poprvé, co spolu takto hovořili od letošního března, kdy se obě země dohodly na obnovení diplomatických vztahů.\n\nUSA chtějí Izraeli také pomoci ve snaze dostat zpět na 150 rukojmích, které palestinští ozbrojenci mají ve své moci. Jsou mezi nimi i Američané, kterých se v oblasti jižního Izraele nadále pohřešuje nejméně 17. Dalších 22 jich při útoku radikálů zemřelo.\n\nKvůli situaci v regionu americké ministerstvo zahraničí zvýšilo varování před cestami do Izraele a na Západní břeh na třetí ze čtyř stupňů. Podle Washingtonu zde hrozí teroristické útoky a nepokoje. Nejvyšší stupeň varování platí pro Pásmo Gazy, které je denně terčem masivních izraelských náletů.\n\nV Gaze je mimo domovy 338 tisíc lidí\n\nIzraelské odvetné údery si zatím podle agentury DPA vyžádaly nejméně 1100 životů a přes 5300 zraněných. Biden i proto na Izrael apeloval, aby v oblasti postupoval v souladu s „pravidly války“.\n\nSvé domovy v Pásmu Gazy kvůli izraelským útokům opustilo podle OSN už 338 tisíc lidí. Nejméně 51 dalších osob v noci na čtvrtek při náletech zemřelo, přes 280 jich utrpělo zranění. Informují o tom agentura AFP a server listu The Times of Israel.\n\nKvůli složité humanitární situaci v Pásmu Gazy, které čelí izraelské „totální blokádě“, ve středu generální tajemník OSN António Guterres vyzval Izrael, aby umožnil dodávky potravin, paliva a vody do oblasti.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Podle agentury AP o tom informovalo spolkové ministerstvo vnitra.\n\n\nDomovní prohlídky se odehrály v Berlíně, Dolním Sasku, severním Porýní-Vestfálsku a Šlesvicku-Holštýnsku. Těžiště razií bylo podle agentury AP v hlavním městě, kde tři stovky policistů s cílem shromáždit důkazy a zabavit majetek prohledaly celkem jedenáct míst. Sedm razií se týkalo Hamásu, čtyři Samidúnu.\n\nV Bochumi policie vtrhla do bytu, kde žije lékař označovaný v německých médiích jako Ramy G, který na sociálních sítích vystupuje proti Izraeli a přes spolek Palestinské společenství Německo podporuje teroristy z Hamásu.\n\n„Se zákazy Hamásu a Samidúnu jsme v Německu vyslali jasný signál, že nebudeme trpět žádné oslavování a podporu barbarského teroru Hamásu proti Izraeli,“ prohlásila německá ministryně vnitra Nancy Faeserová. „Islamisté a antisemité se nemohou a nesmějí nikde cítit bezpečně. Takoví radikálové musejí počítat s největší tvrdostí právního státu. Islamistickou scénu bedlivě sledujeme,“ dodala.\n\nNěmecké tajné služby odhadují, že Hamás má v zemi asi 450 členů. Jejich aktivity sahají od projevů sympatií a propagandistických aktivit až po financování a fundraisingové aktivity k posílení organizace v zahraničí.\n\nV Berlíně ve středu skončilo dvoudenní zasedání Německé islámské konference (DIK) považované za fórum německé vlády pro komunikaci s muslimskou společností. Faeserová během diskuse prohlásila, že Německo má problém s antisemitismem, který se týká nejen většinové společnosti, ale také muslimů žijících v zemi. Zdůraznila, že takové projevy nebude tolerovat, protože antisemitismus je největší hrozbou pro německou demokracii.\n\nNěmecká města a především Berlín byla po 7. říjnu, kdy Hamás zaútočil na Izrael a zavraždil tam 1200 lidí a dalších 240 zavlekl jako rukojmí do Pásma Gazy, dějištěm mnoha propalestinských akcí.\n\nZprvu některé dokonce oslavovaly počínání Hamásu na jihu židovského státu. Později, když Izrael udeřil na pozice teroristů, demonstrace požadovaly ukončení vojenských akcí s poukazem na počet civilních obětí. Hamásem řízené palestinské úřady v Gaze tvrdí, že překonal 14 tisíc. Číslo však nelze ověřit z nezávislých zdrojů.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "The text to analyze is: ANALÝZA: Proč Egypt nechce přijmout uprchlíky z Gazy\n\nSituace okolo otevření přechodu Rafáh mezi Pásmem Gazy a Egyptem je nejasná. Během pondělního dopoledne se objevovaly protikladné zprávy. Agentura Reuters uvedla s odvoláním na dva egyptské představitele, že Izrael souhlasil od deváté ráno s přerušením palby. Izraelský premiér to následně popřel.\n\n\n„V tuto chvíli není žádné přerušení palby kvůli dodávce humanitární pomoci a odchodu cizinců,“ řekl Benjamin Netanjahu podle listu The Times of Israel.\n\nProti otevření je několik ministrů vládnoucí strany Likud. K uvolnění blokády a dodávkám humanitární pomoci do Pásma Gazy přes přechod v Rafáhu se odmítavě staví například ministr energetiky Israel Katz: „Náš závazek je vůči rodinám zavražděných a unesených rukojmí, ne k Hamásu a těm, kdo mu pomáhali.“\n\nVyjádření Egypťanů agentuře Reuters další strany nepotvrdily. „Na žádost o potvrzení (přerušení palby a otevření přechodu) izraelská armáda i americké velvyslanectví v Izraeli uvedly, že k tomu aktuálně nemají vyjádření,“ napsala agentura. Podle listu The Guardian otevření hranice do Egypta nepotvrdilo ani hnutí Hamás vládnoucí v Pásmu Gazy.\n\nAmerický ministr zahraničí Antony Blinken však tvrdil, že přechod otevřen bude: „Rafáh se znovu otevře. Spolu s OSN, Egyptem, Izraelem a dalšími implementujeme mechanismus, jehož prostřednictvím se dostane pomoc k lidem, kteří ji potřebují.“ Podrobnosti ovšem neuvedl a není jasné, kdy by k tomu mělo dojít.\n\nMožnost odejít by měli mít cizinci a Palestinci s dvojím občanstvím. Videa však zachycují davy lidí včetně rodin s malými dětmi čekajících na otevření přechodu. Na egyptské straně přechodu stojí kolony nákladních aut s pomocí.\n\nJediná cesta z Gazy je omezená\n\nRafáh je jediný přechod, který spojuje Pásmo Gazy s Egyptem, a je to v současnosti jediné místo, kudy se z Pásma mohou Palestinci dostat. Egypt ale už během konfliktů mezi Hamásem a Izraelem v letech 2008, 2014 a 2021 nechával přechod uzavřený. Omezení pro přechod platí od roku 2013, kdy se Egypt potýkal s teroristy z Islámského státu, kteří ovládli severní oblasti Sinaje.\n\nU hranice s Pásmem Gazy byly poté zničeny i domy a farmy a lidé odtamtud byli vyhnáni. Egypt tam vytvořil nárazníkovou zónu, kterou kontroluje armáda.\n\nPalestinské vedení opakovaně kritizovalo Egypt, že podle něj de facto zesiluje blokádu, kterou zavedl Izrael na Pásmo Gazy, poté co území v roce 2007 definitivně ovládl Hamás.\n\nSísí: A co když nám tu zůstanou?\n\nEgyptský prezident Abdal Fatah Sísí podle listu The Guardian dal opakovaně najevo, že nechce umožnit Palestincům z Gazy utéci před válkou na Sinajský poloostrov. Bojí se, že by tam zůstali a po konci bojů už se nevrátili do Pásma, kdy jich nyní žije asi 2,3 milionu.\n\nZdůvodňoval to slovy, že by tak mohl Izrael mít prázdné Pásmo Gazy na úkor Egypta: „Egypt neumožní likvidaci palestinské otázky na účet dalších stran. Za žádných okolností tu nebude žádná shovívavost nebo oslabení egyptské národní bezpečnosti.“\n\nPrávě oslabení bezpečnosti hraje významnou roli. Hamás, který vládne v Pásmu Gazy a podnikl brutální teroristický útok na Izrael, při němž zavraždil na 1300 jeho občanů a nejméně 130 jich unesl jako rukojmí, je napojen na Muslimské bratrstvo, které po svržení prezidenta Husního Mubaraka vyhrálo volby. Právě Sísí následně vládu islamistů svrhnul.\n\nProti odchodu Palestinců z Gazy je však i vůdce politického křídla Hamásu Ismaíl Haníja, který z bezpečí své rezidence v Kataru řekl, že k žádné migraci obyvatel z Gazy do Egypta nedojde. Pokud by totiž Palestinci odešli, neměl by komu vládnout.\n\nEgypt se vždy stavěl proti návrhům, že by přijal Palestince, nebo dokonce na jeho území vznikl samostatný palestinský stát, jak to údajně navrhoval v roce 2010 Benjamin Netanjahu. Mubarak v roce 2017 vehementně popíral nepodložená tvrzení, že by se v roce 1983 dohodl s tehdejší britskou premiérkou Margaret Thatcherovou, že by dal souhlas s přesídlením Palestinců z Libanonu na Sinaj.\n\nAktuálně by pro Egypt byla jakákoliv palestinská migrační vlna složitá, protože je sám v hospodářské krizi a síla jeho měny klesá. Nezávislá stanice Mada Masr však uvádí, že v části egyptských kruhů by byla ochota větší množství Palestinců přijmout výměnou za ekonomickou pomoc a investiční pobídky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Demonstranti v Praze hned reagovali\n\nPoužívání hesla „From the river to the sea Palestine will be free“ (Od řeky k moři Palestina bude svobodná) může být za určitých okolností považováno za trestný čin, uvedlo ve středu ministerstvo vnitra. Policisté se proto budou na demonstracích více zaměřovat na používání sloganu na transparentech či na jeho provolávání.\n\n\nUžití tohoto hesla „je v kontextu útoku Hamásu proti Izraeli ze 7. října 2023 problematické a mohlo by naplňovat znaky trestného činu,“ uvedlo ministerstvo vnitra v tiskové zprávě.\n\nVazba na hnutí Hamás a další organizace volající po zničení státu Izrael je podle resortu jednoznačná.\n\n„Heslo bylo historicky většinově využíváno ve spojení s jasně deklarovaným požadavkem na zničení existence státu Izrael a odstranění části obyvatelstva jakoukoli, i násilnou formou,“ napsalo ministerstvo.\n\nZávěr vyplývá ze středeční schůzky, které se účastnili zástupci resortu vnitra, vedení policejního prezidia, Krajského ředitelství policie hlavního města Prahy, Národní centrály proti terorismu, extremismu a kybernetické kriminalitě, Nejvyššího státního zastupitelství a pražského magistrátu.\n\nPodle ministerstva vnitra by propagace hesla mohla naplňovat znaky skutkové podstaty trestných činů podpory a propagace terorismu, podněcování nenávisti proti skupině osob či popírání, zpochybňování, schvalování a ospravedlňování genocidia.\n\nNa propalestinských demonstracích zaznívající slogan „From the river to the sea“ je mnohými považován za genocidní heslo palestinských nacionalistů. Například německé Bavorsko se před pár dny rozhodlo, že ho bude postihovat jako podporu terorismu.\n\nAll people must be free\n\nTransparenty se zmíněným sloganem se objevují i na demonstracích v Praze. Ministr vnitra Vít Rakušan už před pár dny v rozhovoru pro Novinky řekl, že osobně podobné výroky považuje za hranou.\n\nNa středeční propalestinské demonstraci na Staroměstském náměstí hned organizátoři vyzvali účastníky, kterých byly odhadem asi dvě stovky, aby ho nepoužívali, že jim hrozí postih. Navrhli jim, ať ho kdyžtak pozmění na „…all people must be free“ (všichni lidé musí být svobodní).\n\nPolicisté se podle ministerstva vnitra budou na základě výstupu středeční schůzky na demonstracích více zaměřovat na provolávání či propagaci zmíněného hesla. Případy pak následně budou vyhodnocovat individuálně. Zároveň bude policie o tom, že heslo není žádoucí, předem informovat svolavatele demonstrací.\n\nOd útoku palestinského teroristického hnutí Hamás na Izrael 7. října celosvětově začal vzrůstat počet projevů antisemitismu. Podle Federace židovských obcí jen v Česku počet protižidovských projevů vzrostl o zhruba 400 procent. Podle nedělního vyjádření policejního prezidenta Martina Vondráčka zatím policie stíhá za projevy antisemitismu 14 lidí.\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "The text to analyze is: Angelina Jolie se vyjádřila ke Gaze. Nejdřív jí vynadal její otec, pak i izraelský prezident\n\nHollywoodská hvězda Angelina Jolie (48) se dostala pod palbu za svá prohlášení o izraelské válce proti Hamásu. Nejprve od svého otce Jona Voighta (84), nyní dokonce od izraelského prezidenta Jicchaka Herzoga (63).\n\n\n„Angelina Jolie nenabízí izraelskému lidu žádnou možnost obrany,“ vysvětlil Herzog podle listu Bild v jednom rozhovoru.\n\nCo se stalo? Angelina Jolie se k současné situaci v Izraeli vyjádřila na svém instagramovém profilu. V prvním příspěvku odsoudila „teroristický útok“ Hamásu, aniž by ho označila za teroristickou organizaci. Napsala, že ji „smrt tolika nevinných civilistů rozhořčila“. „Modlím se za okamžitý a bezpečný návrat rukojmích,“ podotkla.\n\nJolie: Gaza je vězení\n\nVe druhém příspěvku Jolie napsala k fotografii, která zachycuje oblast v Gaze po zásahu raketou: „Toto je záměrné bombardování uvězněného obyvatelstva, které nemá kam utéct. Gaza je již téměř dvě desetiletí vězením pod širým nebem a rychle se stává masovým hrobem.“\n\nIzraelské údery v Gaze si podle palestinských zdrojů vyžádaly již přes 10 tisíc mrtvých.\n\nOtec Jon Voight: Jsem velmi zklamaný\n\nPozoruhodné je, že se ozval především její otec herec Jon Voight („Návrat domů“) - a to velmi jasně: „Jsem velmi zklamaný, že moje dcera, stejně jako mnoho dalších, nemá pochopení pro Boží čest a Boží pravdy,“ řekl ve videu zveřejněném na své stránce na Instagramu.\n\n„Jde o zničení svaté země“, pokračoval Voight. „Izrael musí chránit svůj lid a svou půdu. Tuto zemi napadl nelidský teror namířený proti nevinným ženám a dětem“.\n\nHerzog: Myslím, že v Gaze nikdy nebyla\n\nDo debaty zasáhl také izraelský prezident Herzog, který ve svém prohlášení reagoval na hereččin výrok, že Gaza je vězení pod širým nebem. „Gaza je vězení, ale ne kvůli Izraeli. Izrael se z Gazy stáhl. Gaza je íránská základna infiltrovaná terorem,“ prohlásil.\n\nHerzog uvedl, že s výroky Angeliny Jolie nesouhlasí ve všech ohledech. „Myslím, že v Gaze nikdy nebyla, nikdy se nepodívala na situaci na místě,“ řekl Herzog v rozhovoru s britským novinářem Piersem Morganem. Dále pokračoval: „V Gaze je válka, ale není tam žádná humanitární krize, která by lidem neumožňovala přežít.“\n\nHerzog se v rozhovoru také zamýšlel nad tím, jak by věci mohly pokračovat po válce: „Snad výsledek této války umožní lidem v Gaze žít slušný a dobrý život v jiném režimu, který umožní posun k míru.“\n\n\n\n"

It takes into account international responses to the conflict, both political (diplomatic statements, protests and calls for action by the global community) and civic (demonstrations in support of Israel or Palestine, discussions on academic campuses).

If a Hamas member is cited in connection with violent actions, rocket attacks, or other terrorist activities, include them in this category.), Independent experts and researchers (Experts, academics, researchers or commentators specializing in Middle East affairs, conflict resolution, international relations or related fields, providing understanding and analysis of the conflict. If the actor is an ambassador/diplomat, classify them as a political representative of the country concerned.), Media and journalists (The text cites information taken from other media (e.g. \"\"according to the New York Times...), to which no other spokesperson is assigned (it may be an investigative media outlet, information provided anonymously, etc.)), Eyewitnesses and civilians from Israel (Israeli civilians affected by the conflict, providing testimony, or commentary.

Má se tak stát ve „vhodném okamžiku“\n\nSněmovna vyzývá vládu, aby českou ambasádu přesunula do Jeruzaléma ve „vhodném okamžiku“, shodli se ve společném usnesení poslanci. Vykličkovali tak z neshod mezi vládní pětikoalicí. ODS, KDU-ČSL, ANO i SPD totiž po tomto kroku volají. STAN a TOP 09 jsou zdrženlivější a Piráti v čele se svým ministrem zahraničí Janem Lipavským se v tuto chvíli postavili proti.\n\n\n„Poslanecká sněmovna vyzývá vládu, aby ve vhodném okamžiku přesunula ambasádu ČR do Jeruzaléma,“ stojí v usnesení, pro které v úterý hlasovalo všech 162 přihlášených poslanců.\n\nTi zároveň důrazně odsoudili agresi teroristického hnutí Hamás vůči státu Izrael. Také vyjádřili jednoznačnou podporu a solidaritu Izraeli a jeho obyvatelům a podpořili jejich právo na přijetí vojenských a jiných opatření k zajištění své bezpečnosti.\n\n„Považuji za důležité, abychom se v tuto chvíli postavili za Izrael. Jsem za to rád, že se tak děje. Probíhá tam zápas o korunu lidství. Navrhované usnesení je vyjádření naší solidarity,“ uvedl na plénu místopředseda Sněmovny a předseda meziparlamentní skupiny ČR – Izrael Jan Bartošek (KDU-ČSL).\n\nPodle něj „vhodný okamžik“ znamená, že by bylo téma „vhodné otevřít poté, co se situace uklidní.“ „Dobrý postup by byl, kdyby k přesunutí došlo v rámci více států Evropské unie,“ navrhl na tiskové konferenci.\n\nZákonodárci se už dopoledne shodli, že usnesení přijmou. Otázkou ale bylo, zda v něm bude zmíněn i přesun ambasády z Tel Avivu do Jeruzaléma.\n\nLipavský: Pro přesun nejsou splněné tři podmínky\n\nTo v úterý dopoledne odmítl Lipavský s tím, že pro přestěhování ambasády nejsou v tuto chvíli splněny tři základní podmínky. Podle něj by byl přesun českého zastoupení v rozporu s mezinárodním právem a rezolucemi Rady bezpečnosti OSN. Dále poukázal na to, že by takový krok nebyl v souladu s jednotným postojem Evropské unie.\n\nV nynější bezpečnostně rozbouřené době navíc Lipavský nepovažuje za rozumné, aby na sebe Česko přitáhlo pozornost mezinárodního společenství razantním krokem v otázce izraelsko-palestinského konfliktu.\n\nStanovisko ministra respektuje i hnutí STAN. TOP 09 přesun „v principu podporuje“.\n\nNaopak podle premiéra Petra Fialy (ODS) by byl přesun v současné době „žádoucí krok.“ Podobně mluví i KDU-ČSL, jehož předseda Marian Jurečka Novinkám řekl, že „bude rád, když změnu provedou, jakmile to bude možné“. Podporu má krok i u opozičních hnutí ANO a SPD.\n\nAby o přesunu ambasády poslanci v úterý hlouběji jednali, se snažil na plénu protlačit šéf hnutí ANO Andrej Babiš. Jím navržený bod ale podpořili pouze zástupci hnutí ANO, SPD a jeden člen hnutí STAN, a to Petr Gazdík. Bod tedy neprošel.\n\n\n\n"

Kvůli názorům na Izrael ho nikdo nechce ubytovat\n\nBritský hudebník Roger Waters, někdejší frontman kapely Pink Floyd, si stěžuje na to, že jej během turné po Latinské Americe odmítly ubytovat hotely v Argentině a Uruguayi. Podle něj je to kvůli jeho propalestinským postojům a „organizovanému bojkotu“. Napsal o tom argentinský deník Página 12. Představitelé židovské komunity v Uruguayi označili Waterse za antisemitu.\n\n\nWaters má v rámci koncertního turné This is Not a Drill v pátek vystoupit v uruguayské metropoli Montevideu, příští týden má odehrát dva koncerty v Buenos Aires.\n\n„Město Montevideo je pro mě uzavřené, nemám kde bydlet. Musím tam v den koncertu doletět,“ řekl Waters deníku Página 12. „Ti idioti z izraelské lobby přibrali všechny hotely v Montevideu a Buenos Aires a zorganizovali tenhle neuvěřitelný bojkot založený na zlovolných lžích, které o mně šíří,“ dodal.\n\nWaters řekl, že kvůli bojkotu musel mimo jiné zrušit domluvenou večeři s bývalým uruguayským prezidentem Josém Mujicou, kterého označil za svého přítele. Podle uruguayských médií bude muset Waters na koncerty v Argentině a Uruguayi letět z Brazílie.\n\nHotely v Montevideu, které oslovila agentura AFP, odmítly zprávu o údajně zrušených rezervacích komentovat.\n\nPředseda uruguayského Ústředního židovského výboru Roby Schindler potvrdil, že zaslal dopis hotelu Sofitel, v němž žádal, aby Waterse neubytovával. „Pokud jej přijmete, tak budete chtě nechtě propagovat nenávist, kterou ten muž produkuje,“ napsal Schindler, který Waterse označil za člověka, který zneužívá své slávy k šíření nenávisti proti Izraeli a proti Židům.\n\nObvinění z antisemitismu se kolem Waterse množí už roky. Waters je velmi kritický vůči Izraeli, mimo jiné ho označil za „stát apartheidu“ a v současném konfliktu mezi Izraelem a Hamásem hájí Palestince.\n\nV rozhovoru s americkým novinářem Glennem Greenwaldem Waters řekl, že Izrael uměle dramatizuje a zveličuje útok Hamásu ze 7. října a „vymýšlí si příběhy o sťatých dětech“, napsala agentura AP.\n\n\n\n"

Cílem cesty je podpora Izraele.\n\n\n„Předseda vlády Petr Fiala se zítra setká se svým izraelským protějškem Benjaminem Netanjahu a izraelským prezidentem Jicchakem Herzogem,“ napsal Novinkám Smolka. Zároveň potvrdil, že s Fialou poletí do Izraele i rakouský kancléř.\n\nCílem jednání bude podle mluvčího české vlády podpora Izraele. „A to včetně koordinace v kontextu Evropské rady, která zasedá tento týden,“ upozornil Smolka.\n\nJako první o cestě informovala rakouská agentura APA s odvoláním na úřad kancléře. Cílem cesty je podle agentury „ukázat solidaritu s izraelským lidem“.\n\nO situaci na Blízkém východě v úterý Fiala mluvil při obědě s prezidentem Petrem Pavlem. „Probírali jsme současné světově dění, především teroristický útok Hamásu na Izrael a situaci na Blízkém východě,“ poznamenal mimo jiné premiér.\n\nPo útocích Hamásu Izraeli vyjadřuje podporu řada západních zemí. V úterý Izrael navštívil francouzský prezident Emmanuel Macron a také mu dal najevo „plnou solidaritu“, v zemi už také byli například německý kancléř Olaf Scholz či britský premiér Rishi Sunak. Minulý týden do Izraele přijel americký prezident Joe Biden.\n\nVůbec první politik, který navštívil Izrael po začátku války, byl český ministr zahraničí Jan Lipavský (Piráti). Ten se tam 10. října setkal se svým protějškem Elim Kohenem i s izraelským prezidentem. Ze země zároveň odvezl 34 Čechů. Pak následovaly další repatriační lety.\n\nIzrael vede válku proti radikálnímu palestinskému hnutí Hamás ovládajícímu Pásmo Gazy. Hamás 7. října provedl na jihu Izraele neočekávaný a krvavý útok, který si vyžádal životy více než 1400 lidí, převážně civilistů. Při následných izraelských akcích přišlo podle palestinských úřadů o život skoro 5800 lidí.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
